## The Kaelmar Strait Crisis
- **The strait** divides the Delvarian Empire (north channel) from the Thessarine Confederation (south channel), per the Treaty of Ashen Bluffs (1987)
- **Delvarian naval buildup** — 11+ warships observed in formation near northern passage (reported 15 Feb 2026). Delvaria calls them "routine exercises."
- **Thessarine response** — Reservists recalled to island garrisons. Ambassador Evren Soldt recalled from Kharstad (15 Feb). Foreign Secretary Alaric Daine accuses Delvaria of violating the Treaty of Ashen Bluffs. Delvaria calls recall "theatrical posturing."
- **Most significant diplomatic rupture in ~40 years**
- **Ashford Republic mediation proposal** (17 Feb) — Foreign Minister Luisa Vandermeer proposes emergency talks at Fenmouth. Thessarine cautiously welcomes; Delvaria rejects it as "unnecessary interference in sovereign affairs."
- **Fenmouth** — Neutral port city in the Ashford Republic. Site of the 1962 Maritime Accords that established Narrow Sea freedom of navigation principles.
- **Delvarian live-fire exercises** (18 Feb) — Northern Fleet conducted gunnery drills in the northern channel, involving 7+ warships including heavy cruiser *Kharstad's Pride*. Closed northern passage to commercial traffic for ~6 hours. Delvarian Ministry called drills "routine and pre-scheduled." Most provocative military action since crisis began. Three Bobington-registered cargo vessels diverted.
- **Thessarine garrison reinforcement** (18 Feb) — Confederation began reinforcing island chain garrisons with coastal defence batteries and logistics personnel. Foreign Secretary Daine condemned exercises as "reckless provocation." Fleet at "elevated readiness" but no full naval mobilisation announced.
- **Impact on Bobington** — ~1/3 of copper imports and ~half of eastern spice trade pass through the strait. Copper at 862 fl/tonne (Tue close, up from 843 Mon). Shipping insurance doubled for Kaelmar routes. Shipowners rerouting via Cape of Sarenne (+12-15 days). Eastern spice prices up 8-15%. Sustained closure could add 15-22% to landed cost of eastern goods.
- **Bobington's position** — Foreign Office dispatched Sir Duncan Hale as envoy to Thessara (17 Feb). Hale arrived Thessara 18 Feb, met with senior Thessarine officials at Confederation Hall. Exploring alternative diplomatic framework that Delvaria might accept (bypassing rejected Fenmouth proposal). Consul Miren received Foreign Office delegation at Ashbury Lane consulate (18 Feb).
