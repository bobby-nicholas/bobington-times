## The Kaelmar Strait Crisis
- **The strait** divides the Delvarian Empire (north channel) from the Thessarine Confederation (south channel), per the Treaty of Ashen Bluffs (1987)
- **Delvarian naval buildup** — 11+ warships observed in formation near northern passage (reported 15 Feb 2026). Delvaria calls them "routine exercises."
- **Thessarine response** — Reservists recalled to island garrisons. Ambassador Evren Soldt recalled from Kharstad (15 Feb). Foreign Secretary Alaric Daine accuses Delvaria of violating the Treaty of Ashen Bluffs. Delvaria calls recall "theatrical posturing."
- **Most significant diplomatic rupture in ~40 years**
- **Ashford Republic mediation proposal** (17 Feb) — Foreign Minister Luisa Vandermeer proposes emergency talks at Fenmouth. Thessarine cautiously welcomes; Delvaria rejects it as "unnecessary interference in sovereign affairs."
- **Fenmouth** — Neutral port city in the Ashford Republic. Site of the 1962 Maritime Accords that established Narrow Sea freedom of navigation principles.
- **Delvarian live-fire exercises** (18 Feb) — Northern Fleet conducted gunnery drills in the northern channel, involving 7+ warships including heavy cruiser *Kharstad's Pride*. Closed northern passage to commercial traffic for ~6 hours. Delvarian Ministry called drills "routine and pre-scheduled." Most provocative military action since crisis began. Three Bobington-registered cargo vessels diverted.
- **Thessarine garrison reinforcement** (18 Feb) — Confederation began reinforcing island chain garrisons with coastal defence batteries and logistics personnel. Foreign Secretary Daine condemned exercises as "reckless provocation." Fleet at "elevated readiness" but no full naval mobilisation announced.
- **Impact on Bobington** — ~1/3 of copper imports and ~half of eastern spice trade pass through the strait. Copper at 862 fl/tonne (Tue close, up from 843 Mon). Shipping insurance doubled for Kaelmar routes. Shipowners rerouting via Cape of Sarenne (+12-15 days). Eastern spice prices up 8-15%. Sustained closure could add 15-22% to landed cost of eastern goods.
- **Bobington's position** — Foreign Office dispatched Sir Duncan Hale as envoy to Thessara (17 Feb). Hale arrived Thessara 18 Feb, met with senior Thessarine officials at Confederation Hall. 
- **Hale's "Quiet Channel" proposal** (19 Feb) — Hale proposes a discreet bilateral framework: Bobington facilitates direct, private communication between Delvarian and Thessarine senior officials via designated envoys operating outside formal diplomatic apparatus. No preconditions, no published agenda, no obligation to announce results. Designed to address Delvaria's objections to multilateral/public Fenmouth format. Foreign Secretary Daine met Hale ~90 mins at Confederation Hall (19 Feb); no public statement (positive sign per observers). Delvaria silent — *Kharstad Gazette* described Hale as "a Bobington trade official." Hale dined privately with senior Confederation officials Wed evening.
- Consul Miren received Foreign Office delegation at Ashbury Lane consulate (18 Feb).
- **Stormbreak incident** (19 Feb) — Thessarine corvette *Vantara* intercepted Delvarian-flagged fishing trawler *Stormbreak* approximately 4 NM south of the Treaty demarcation line in the southern channel. Vessel detained ~6 hours, crew of 9 confined to forward mess. Released after inspection; radio confiscated (frequency range exceeded civilian specs). Hold contained silver mackerel. Delvaria: "unacceptable provocation against maritime workers." Thessara: acted "in accordance with treaty obligations." First direct physical encounter between the two nations' forces since crisis began.
- **Delvarian consul engagement** (19 Feb) — Consul Pehr Lindqvist, Delvarian consul in Bobington (3 years, career diplomat), requested private meeting with senior Bobington Foreign Office official. First direct Delvarian diplomatic engagement since crisis began. Meeting expected Friday 20 Feb. No agenda communicated. Possibly connected to Hale's quiet channel proposal.
- **Daine assigns aide to Hale** (19 Feb) — Thessarine Foreign Secretary Daine assigned a senior aide as Hale's primary interlocutor, consistent with formalising the quiet channel framework.
- **Lindqvist meets Foreign Office** (21 Feb) — Consul Lindqvist met Undersecretary for Eastern Affairs Helena Marchetti at the Foreign Office on Chancery Row for approximately 90 minutes on Friday afternoon. Foreign Office described conversation as "substantive and frank." Delvarian consulate characterised it as "normal diplomatic activities." Sources: Lindqvist was "receptive but cautious" on quiet channel framework. Delvarian conditions: (1) no preconditions on northern channel naval exercises, (2) strictly bilateral — no multilateral/Ashford Republic involvement, (3) Delvaria to designate its own envoy (not consul). Hale briefed in Thessara Friday evening. Thessarine Foreign Secretary Daine's office notably dropped "multilateral" from its statement language. No formal Delvarian response timeline. *Kharstad Gazette* ran front-page "Nine Fishermen, One Empire's Honour" on Stormbreak crew.
- **Kharstad Gazette editorial** (22 Feb) — "The Duty of Restraint." Strikingly moderate tone; phrases like "bilateral discretion" and "restraint from a position of power." Diplomatic observers read it as signal Delvaria seriously considering quiet channel.
- **Delvarian statement** (24 Feb, Mon) — Ministry of External Affairs issues 47-word statement: "The Empire maintains ongoing bilateral contacts with interested parties regarding matters of maritime security in the Kaelmar region. The Empire favours discreet, bilateral resolution of differences and will continue to act in defence of its sovereign interests." First official acknowledgement of any diplomatic process. Mirrors Hale's "quiet channel" language. Drops earlier dismissive tone. No envoy named. *Kharstad Gazette* ran it on page two without additional comment. Thornbury: "Someone in Kharstad has made a decision."
- **Hale reaction** (24 Feb) — Called the statement "constructive." Sources say Hale was briefed before it was issued — indicating bilateral channel is functioning informally.
- **Thessarine reaction** (24 Feb) — Foreign Secretary's office: "notes the statement and reiterates its commitment to resolving differences through dialogue consistent with the Treaty of Ashen Bluffs." Notably measured; drops earlier "reckless provocation" language.
- **Lindqvist** (24 Feb) — Seen arriving at Bobington Foreign Office on Chancery Row Mon morning. Unannounced visit; Foreign Office confirmed "a scheduled meeting."
- **Copper** — Opened Mon 24 Feb at 883 (cautious optimism on diplomatic signal), recovered to 889 by mid-morning as commission testimony reasserted demand reality. Rose to 891 by midday. Merchants' Guild: 12 vessels now rerouting via Sarenne; total fleet costs exceeding 1.6M florins.
