## The Kaelmar Strait Crisis
- **The strait** divides the Delvarian Empire (north channel) from the Thessarine Confederation (south channel), per the Treaty of Ashen Bluffs (1987)
- **Delvarian naval buildup** — 11+ warships observed in formation near northern passage (reported 15 Feb 2026). Delvaria calls them "routine exercises."
- **Thessarine response** — Reservists recalled to island garrisons. Ambassador Evren Soldt recalled from Kharstad (15 Feb). Foreign Secretary Alaric Daine accuses Delvaria of violating the Treaty of Ashen Bluffs. Delvaria calls recall "theatrical posturing."
- **Most significant diplomatic rupture in ~40 years**
- **Impact on Bobington** — ~1/3 of copper imports and ~half of eastern spice trade pass through the strait. Copper futures surged 14% to 847 florins/tonne (12-year high) at Bramblegate Exchange.
- **Bobington's position** — Foreign Office issued restrained statement urging dialogue and respect for international maritime law.
