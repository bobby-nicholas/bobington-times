## The Kaelmar Strait Crisis
- **The strait** divides the Delvarian Empire (north channel) from the Thessarine Confederation (south channel), per the Treaty of Ashen Bluffs (1987)
- **Delvarian naval buildup** — 11+ warships observed in formation near northern passage (reported 15 Feb 2026). Delvaria calls them "routine exercises."
- **Thessarine response** — Reservists recalled to island garrisons. Ambassador Evren Soldt recalled from Kharstad (15 Feb). Foreign Secretary Alaric Daine accuses Delvaria of violating the Treaty of Ashen Bluffs. Delvaria calls recall "theatrical posturing."
- **Most significant diplomatic rupture in ~40 years**
- **Ashford Republic mediation proposal** (17 Feb) — Foreign Minister Luisa Vandermeer proposes emergency talks at Fenmouth. Thessarine cautiously welcomes; Delvaria rejects it as "unnecessary interference in sovereign affairs."
- **Fenmouth** — Neutral port city in the Ashford Republic. Site of the 1962 Maritime Accords that established Narrow Sea freedom of navigation principles.
- **Impact on Bobington** — ~1/3 of copper imports and ~half of eastern spice trade pass through the strait. Copper at 843 fl/tonne (Mon close). Shipping insurance doubled for Kaelmar routes. Shipowners rerouting via Cape of Sarenne (+12-15 days). Eastern spice prices up 8-15%.
- **Bobington's position** — Foreign Office dispatched Sir Duncan Hale as envoy to Thessara (17 Feb). Previously issued restrained statement urging dialogue.
