## Ringball

A major sport in Bobington and the wider nation. Played on an oval pitch. Key features:
- **The Ring** — An elevated hoop mounted on a tall post. Scoring involves launching (arcing) the ball through it.
- **Lodges** — Positions/zones on the pitch (left lodge, right lodge). Players rotate through lodges.
- **Positions:** Centrist (playmaker), lock (close-range), keeper (defensive). Markers are defenders.
- **Match structure:** Four quarters. Drop at the start of each quarter.
- **Scoring:** A ring = points (exact value TBD in future coverage; current match scores suggest ~5 pts per ring plus additional scoring methods). Clearances are a defensive stat for keepers.
- **Key mechanic:** The "arc" — a curved throw/launch toward the ring, can be flat or sweeping.
- **Cornerwork** — Tactical play near the edges of the oval.
