# Economy & Commerce

## Currency
- **The florin** — Bobington's currency. Subdivided into centimes (50-centime tram fare mentioned).

## Key Economic Facts
- **Copper** — Major import via Kaelmar Strait (~1/3 of supply). Futures at 879 florins/tonne (Thu 19 Feb close), up from 871 Wed. New 12-year high (five consecutive sessions of gains). Estimated tramway copper cost overrun: ~460M florins at 879, ~490M at 900, 500M+ at 950. Varga (Fernwich) revised forecast: 900–910 by end of next week if strait remains disrupted. "Every florin copper moves costs the tramway approximately two million" (Municipal Treasury source). Merchants' Guild estimates total cost to Bobington merchant fleet at ~1.2M florins since crisis began (Guildmaster Hadrian Voss). Seven additional vessels rerouted via Cape of Sarenne since Tue.
- **Eastern spice trade** — ~half passes through Kaelmar Strait. Prices up 8-15% (velveroot, black cardamon, dried saffron bark).
- **Shipping insurance** — Premiums doubled for Kaelmar-route cargo. Some underwriters declining new policies. Shipowners rerouting via Cape of Sarenne (+12-15 days).
- **Coffee at Rensler's** — 4 florins (up from 3.60) due to shipping cost increases
- **Greymoor copper** — Domestic supply from Greymoor Highlands, ~2,000 tonnes/year from small mines (Miners' Cooperative of Greymoor, chair: Nils Haversten). Fraction of tramway's ~12,000 tonne need. Scaling up would take 18-24 months and tens of millions in investment.

## Major Projects
- **Veridan Corridor Tramway Expansion** — 14 miles, Docklands to Upper Fernwich via Midtown. 12 stations. Cost: 3.2 billion florins (380M allocated for copper components at 740 fl/tonne baseline). Phase 1 breaks ground autumn 2026 (pending commission recommendation). Full completion spring 2030. 6,000 workers at peak. Greymoor granite for facades. Chief Engineer: Yara Okonkwo.
  - **19 Feb council session:** Okonkwo presented three options: (1) Proceed, absorb 430M+ overrun via bonds (~28M/yr for 20 yrs); (2) Redesign with aluminium substitution (~30% copper reduction, 18-month delay, inferior system); (3) Phase — build Phase 1 only, defer Phase 2 until prices stabilise (2-3 yrs). Cancellation would cost ~180M in termination penalties.
  - **Municipal Treasury:** Contingency reserve at 142M florins (partially drawn down for Bramblegate Market roof repairs). City can borrow but credit rating assumes on-budget delivery. Deputy Treasurer: Annabel Whitford.
  - **Copper Review Commission** established to report by 5 Mar.
