# Economy & Commerce

## Currency
- **The florin** — Bobington's currency. Subdivided into centimes (50-centime tram fare mentioned).

## Key Economic Facts
- **Copper** — Major import via Kaelmar Strait (~1/3 of supply). Futures at 843 florins/tonne (Mon 17 Feb close), down slightly from 847 Sat high. 12-year high. Potential tramway overrun of 380-420M florins if copper reaches 900 and holds.
- **Eastern spice trade** — ~half passes through Kaelmar Strait. Prices up 8-15% (velveroot, black cardamon, dried saffron bark).
- **Shipping insurance** — Premiums doubled for Kaelmar-route cargo. Some underwriters declining new policies. Shipowners rerouting via Cape of Sarenne (+12-15 days).
- **Coffee at Rensler's** — 4 florins (up from 3.60) due to shipping cost increases
- **Greymoor copper** — Domestic supply from Greymoor Highlands, ~2,000 tonnes/year from small mines (Miners' Cooperative of Greymoor, chair: Nils Haversten). Fraction of tramway's ~12,000 tonne need. Scaling up would take 18-24 months and tens of millions in investment.

## Major Projects
- **Veridan Corridor Tramway Expansion** — 14 miles, Docklands to Upper Fernwich via Midtown. 12 stations. Cost: 3.2 billion florins (380M allocated for copper components at 740 fl/tonne baseline). Phase 1 breaks ground autumn 2026. Full completion spring 2030. 6,000 workers at peak. Greymoor granite for facades. Chief Engineer: Yara Okonkwo. Emergency council session called for Wednesday 19 Feb to address copper cost overruns (est. 380-420M fl if copper hits 900).
