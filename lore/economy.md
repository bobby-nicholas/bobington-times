# Economy & Commerce

## Currency
- **The florin** — Bobington's currency. Subdivided into centimes (50-centime tram fare mentioned).

## Key Economic Facts
- **Copper** — Major import via Kaelmar Strait (~1/3 of supply). Futures at 886 florins/tonne (Fri 21 Feb close), up from 879 Thu. New 12-year high (six consecutive sessions of gains, though rate of increase slowing). Estimated tramway copper cost overrun: ~490M florins at 886, 500M+ at 950. Varga (Fernwich) maintains forecast: 900–910 by end of next week if strait remains disrupted. "Every florin copper moves costs the tramway approximately two million" (Municipal Treasury source). Merchants' Guild: total fleet costs ~1.4M florins; 11 vessels rerouted via Cape of Sarenne.
- **Eastern spice trade** — ~half passes through Kaelmar Strait. Prices up 8-15% (velveroot, black cardamon, dried saffron bark).
- **Shipping insurance** — Premiums doubled for Kaelmar-route cargo. Some underwriters declining new policies. Shipowners rerouting via Cape of Sarenne (+12-15 days).
- **Coffee at Rensler's** — 4 florins (up from 3.60) due to shipping cost increases
- **Greymoor copper** — Domestic supply from Greymoor Highlands, ~2,000 tonnes/year from small mines (Miners' Cooperative of Greymoor, chair: Nils Haversten). Fraction of tramway's ~12,000 tonne need. Scaling up would take 18-24 months and tens of millions in investment.

## Major Projects
- **Veridan Corridor Tramway Expansion** — 14 miles, Docklands to Upper Fernwich via Midtown. 12 stations. Cost: 3.2 billion florins (380M allocated for copper components at 740 fl/tonne baseline). Phase 1 breaks ground autumn 2026 (pending commission recommendation). Full completion spring 2030. 6,000 workers at peak. Greymoor granite for facades. Chief Engineer: Yara Okonkwo.
  - **19 Feb council session:** Okonkwo presented three options: (1) Proceed, absorb 430M+ overrun via bonds (~28M/yr for 20 yrs); (2) Redesign with aluminium substitution (~30% copper reduction, 18-month delay, inferior system); (3) Phase — build Phase 1 only, defer Phase 2 until prices stabilise (2-3 yrs). Cancellation would cost ~180M in termination penalties.
  - **Municipal Treasury:** Contingency reserve at 142M florins (partially drawn down for Bramblegate Market roof repairs). City can borrow but credit rating assumes on-budget delivery. Deputy Treasurer: Annabel Whitford.
  - **Copper Review Commission** established to report by 5 Mar.
