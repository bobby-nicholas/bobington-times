# Economy & Commerce

## Currency
- **The florin** — Bobington's currency. Subdivided into centimes (50-centime tram fare mentioned).

## Key Economic Facts
- **Copper** — Major import via Kaelmar Strait (~1/3 of supply). Opened Mon 24 Feb at 889, rose to 891 by midday. Estimated tramway copper cost overrun: ~510M florins at 889, 620M+ at 950 (upper analyst forecast). Funding gap: ~160M florins between available financing (~350M via bonds) and overrun. Okonkwo: cost of delay is 2-3M florins/week in idle costs. Merchants' Guild: total fleet costs now ~1.6M florins; 12 vessels rerouted via Cape of Sarenne.
- **Eastern spice trade** — ~half passes through Kaelmar Strait. Eastern Spice Index (Bramblegate Exchange, 12-spice weighted basket, est. 2003) hit record 348 (Mon 24 Feb close), up 22% in 10 days. Previous record 327 (2018 dock strike). Velveroot exhausted. Black cardamon +18%. Dried saffron bark, golden peppervine, smoked coriander seed +10-20%. At least 7 restaurants pulled signature dishes. Merchants' Guild emergency session Thu 27 Feb at Guild Hall (stockpile management, emergency pricing, petition to Foreign Office). First emergency session since 2011 dockers' strike.
- **Shipping insurance** — Premiums doubled for Kaelmar-route cargo. Some underwriters declining new policies. Shipowners rerouting via Cape of Sarenne (+12-15 days).
- **Coffee at Rensler's** — 4 florins (up from 3.60) due to shipping cost increases
- **Greymoor copper** — Domestic supply from Greymoor Highlands, ~2,000 tonnes/year from small mines (Miners' Cooperative of Greymoor, chair: Nils Haversten). Fraction of tramway's ~12,000 tonne need. Scaling up would take 18-24 months and tens of millions in investment.

## Major Projects
- **Veridan Corridor Tramway Expansion** — 14 miles, Docklands to Upper Fernwich via Midtown. 12 stations. Cost: 3.2 billion florins (380M allocated for copper components at 740 fl/tonne baseline). Phase 1 breaks ground autumn 2026 (pending commission recommendation). Full completion spring 2030. 6,000 workers at peak. Greymoor granite for facades. Chief Engineer: Yara Okonkwo.
  - **19 Feb council session:** Okonkwo presented three options: (1) Proceed, absorb 430M+ overrun via bonds (~28M/yr for 20 yrs); (2) Redesign with aluminium substitution (~30% copper reduction, 18-month delay, inferior system); (3) Phase — build Phase 1 only, defer Phase 2 until prices stabilise (2-3 yrs). Cancellation would cost ~180M in termination penalties.
  - **Municipal Treasury:** Contingency reserve at 142M florins (partially drawn down for Bramblegate Market roof repairs). City can raise ~350M via bonds without downgrade; a 500M+ overrun disclosed before groundbreaking would likely trigger Continental Rating Agency downgrade review, raising borrowing costs 40-60 basis points. Deputy Treasurer: Annabel Whitford.
  - **Copper Review Commission** established to report by 5 Mar. First hearing held 24 Feb.
