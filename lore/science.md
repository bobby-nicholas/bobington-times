# Science & Discovery

This file tracks scientific institutions, discoveries, natural phenomena, and technological advancements in Bobington's world.

## Institutions

- **The Royal Institute of Natural Philosophy** — Bobington's premier scientific body, founded 1743. Located on Arundel Crescent. Hosts public lectures on Thursday evenings. Current President: Professor Elara Whitstone (geologist, volcanologist).
- **Bobington Polytechnic** — The city's engineering and applied sciences college. Strong in electrical engineering and materials science. Dean: Dr. Oswald Fenn.
- **The Cartwright Observatory** — Hilltop observatory in the Marches district, built 1881. Houses the 36-inch Cartwright Refractor. Director: Dr. Sable Nightingale (astronomer).

## Current Scientific Threads

- **Greymoor Highland Luminous Phenomenon** — Persistent diffuse glow above the Greymoor Highlands, first documented by Dr. Odette Collis on 3 Feb 2026. Visible on clear nights (10 PM–2 AM), greenish-white, ~2° band above ridge. Through telescope: faint vertical striations. Spectral signature doesn't match known industrial or atmospheric sources. Coincides roughly in location/time with seismic tremor (23 Feb). Observatory has formally logged it and requested Royal Institute spectroscopic equipment time. See people.md: Dr. Odette Collis.
- **Underground Waterway Survey** — Municipal Works Office comprehensive survey of subsurface hydrology (commissioned by Kinnear, 6 months before Feb 2026). Surveyor Pella Strand discovered a substantial unmapped buried waterway beneath the Docklands — brick-lined, arched, ~2m wide, predates Victorian drainage. ~400m traced. Investigation ongoing through mid-March.

## Natural Phenomena

- **Greymoor Highland Luminous Phenomenon** — See Current Scientific Threads above. Greenish-white glow, vertical striations, visible since 3 Feb 2026. Possibly linked to seismic activity (speculative). Under investigation by Cartwright Observatory and Royal Institute.

## Technology

The world is at roughly an early-to-mid 20th century technological level:
- Electric tramways (Bobington's copper-wire system)
- Motorcar and horse coexistence
- Early radio broadcasting
- Telegraph well-established
- Gas and electric lighting in transition
- No television, no computing, no aviation beyond experimental
