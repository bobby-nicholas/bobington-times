# Politics & Government

## City Government
- **Mayor:** Harriet Blackthorne — supportive of tramway, presenting Freedom of the City to Rovers
- **City Council** — Voted 7-4 to approve Veridan Corridor Tramway Expansion
- **Council Speaker:** Desmond Falk
- **Key council members:** Ida Pryce (Docklands, pro-tramway), Aldric Voss (anti-tramway, fiscal conservative)
- **Municipal Chamber** — City council chamber, marble halls

## Political Dynamics
- Council split between modernisers (Pryce faction, pro-infrastructure) and fiscal conservatives (Voss faction, prioritise schools and emergency services)
- Tramway vote was 7-4, suggesting the modernisers hold a comfortable majority
- Blackthorne aligned with the modernisers

## Law Enforcement
- **Metropolitan Constabulary** — Police force. Investigating Greystone Wharf arson.
- **Fire Marshal's Office** — Edwin Hale leading fire investigations

## Bobington Foreign Office
- Issued restrained statement on Kaelmar Strait tensions urging dialogue (15 Feb)
- Dispatched envoy Sir Duncan Hale to Thessara for consultations (17 Feb)

## Copper Review Commission
- Established 19 Feb by unanimous council vote (11-0)
- Co-chaired by Councilwoman Ida Pryce and Councilman Aldric Voss
- Mandate: assess tramway options (proceed/redesign/phase) and report by 5 March
- **First hearing: Mon 24 Feb** — Municipal Chamber packed to capacity. 200+ DWA members in gallery. Speaker Falk opened with written message from Blackthorne: "The commission has my full confidence." Witnesses: Okonkwo (cost of delay: 2-3M florins/week; overrun ~510M at 889 copper), Whitford (funding gap ~160M florins; bond capacity ~350M without downgrade), Haversten (expansion possible to 3,500 tonnes but geological survey needed after Sun tremor). Voss focused on cost exposure; Pryce steered toward human consequences. Adjourned 12:30. Tuesday session: Merchants' Guild, shipping insurance, public testimony. DWA (Seldon) to present oral testimony.

## Docklands Safety Audit
- Authorised 19 Feb (8-3 vote, Voss and 2 allies opposed on procedural grounds)
- Comprehensive audit of all vacant commercial properties in the Docklands
- Focus: fire safety, insurance compliance, security arrangements
- Proposed by Pryce in the wake of the Greystone Wharf arson
- **Audit began 21 Feb** — Six teams deployed across waterfront (Greystone Wharf to Harrowgate Pier). Coordinated by Fire Marshal Hale with Constabulary and Revenue Office. 72 vacant properties identified for review. 14 preliminary assessments completed on first day; at least 3 with lapsed fire safety certs, 2 with no documentation. Expected 3-4 weeks; preliminary report by mid-March.
- **Ashcroft tax demand** (21 Feb) — Municipal Revenue Office issued formal demand to Ashcroft Property Group for 2,434,600 florins in outstanding vacant building levy (Jan 2024–Feb 2026). 14-day payment deadline (~7 Mar). Crayle disputes calculation and classification of properties as vacant.
- **Falsified fire certificates** (22 Feb) — Day 2 of audit: two warehouses (Chandler's Row and Pilot's Alley) found with fire safety certificates bearing signatures of inspectors not employed at listed dates (2023–2025). Referred to Constabulary. 30 of 72 properties assessed. 5 lapsed certs, 2 with no documentation, 2 falsified, 3 with unauthorised habitation.
- **Commission preparations** (22 Feb) — Pryce and Voss met Saturday to review procedures. Written submissions received from Merchants' Guild (12 pp, supports proceed with modified scope), DWA (5 pp, demands guaranteed wages), Historical Preservation Society (retain Greymoor granite). 200+ DWA members to attend Monday's hearing.

## Political Dynamics (updated)
- Council split tested by copper crisis; forced rare bipartisan cooperation (Pryce-Voss commission)
- Speaker Falk described the pairing as "either inspired or catastrophic"
- Blackthorne navigating between factions; struck tone of "measured resolve"
- Docklands Workers' Association (foreman Patrick Seldon) emerging as new political voice — seeking formal meeting with council re: workforce protections

## Commission Session 2 (25 Feb, Tue)
- Seldon (DWA) delivers 37-minute oral testimony. Names three workers: Ged Halloran (riveter), Petra Voss (cable-layer, no relation), Samuel Obi (19, apprentice welder). Asks for wage guarantees if proceed, transition fund if delay. Quotes 14M florins for 18-month half-wage support (precedent: 2011 dockers' strike settlement). Gallery of 200+ DWA members. Pryce visibly moved. Voss wrote the 14M figure down.
- Guildmaster Hadrian Voss presents Merchants' Guild 12-page submission in person. 12 vessels rerouting, 1.6M+ fleet costs. Supports proceeding at modified scope. Urges phased copper procurement (tranches vs bulk).
- Insurance testimony: Caspar Helmsley (Tidewater Mutual) — no new Kaelmar policies since 12 Feb. Nora Felling (Bobington Insurance Exchange) — 420,000 florins in diversion claims in 10 days.
- Commission interim report expected Friday 28 Feb. Five options on table: proceed at current scope, modified scope, aluminium redesign, phase, or suspend pending diplomacy.
- Wednesday session: Kinnear (infrastructure costs) and Whitstone (domestic copper geology).

## Fernwick Bridge Emergency Ferry
- Approved 25 Feb by emergency infrastructure committee (chaired by Falk). Ashwater River Services (Gwen Alderly) awarded 940,000-florin contract. Route: Thornhill Reach to Bramblegate Steps. First crossings ~6 March.

## Commission Session 3 (26 Feb, Wed)
- Kinnear presents 63-page engineering analysis: three design variants. Full copper spec (12,000 tonnes, 60-year life, 530M+ overrun); aluminium substitution (4,100 tonnes, 30-year life — but rebuild at year 30 costs ~280M); phased approach (Phase 1 only, 5,200 tonnes, ~280M overrun). Kinnear: "You can build a cheaper tramway. You cannot build a cheaper tramway that lasts." Investigated copper-clad aluminium conductors — not manufactured domestically; 3 firms in Ashford Republic only.
- Whitstone on geology: core samples show declining ore grades at depth (2.8% at 40-60m, 1.6% at 80m). Deeper deposits (150m+) exist per 1970s surveys but require new shafts, modern ventilation, major investment. Expansion to 3,500 tonnes feasible but earliest late 2027. Full geological/seismic survey prerequisite: 4 months, 1.2M florins. Tremor seismometer data shows origin at ~4km depth along previously unmapped north-south fault.
- Commission narrowing to phased approach as likely recommendation. Interim report Fri 28 Feb expected to narrow from 5 to 2-3 options.
- Falk: interim report will "narrow the field considerably."
- Final hearing Thu 27 Feb: public comment and co-chair closing statements.

## Upcoming
- **27 Feb (Thu)** — Commission session 4 (final): public comment, closing statements. Merchants' Guild emergency session on spice crisis (Guild Hall, 10 AM); Royal Institute lectures (Calloway 6:30 PM, Whitstone/Fenn 7:30 PM)
- **28 Feb (Fri)** — Commission interim report expected; Albie Finch retirement day
- **5 Mar** — Commission final report deadline
- **~7 Mar** — Ashcroft tax demand payment deadline (14 days from 21 Feb)
