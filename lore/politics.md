## Political Dynamics
- Council split between modernisers (Pryce faction, pro-infrastructure) and fiscal conservatives (Voss faction, prioritise schools and emergency services)

- **First hearing: Mon 24 Feb** — Municipal Chamber packed to capacity. 200+ DWA members in gallery. Speaker Falk opened with written message from Blackthorne: "The commission has my full confidence." Witnesses: Okonkwo (cost of delay: 2-3M florins/week; overrun ~510M at 889 copper), Whitford (funding gap ~160M florins; bond capacity ~350M without downgrade), Haversten (expansion possible to 3,500 tonnes but geological survey needed after Sun tremor).

DWA (Seldon) to present oral testimony.

## Docklands Safety Audit
- Authorised 19 Feb (8-3 vote, Voss and 2 allies opposed on procedural grounds)
- Comprehensive audit of all vacant commercial properties in the Docklands
- Focus: fire safety, insurance compliance, security arrangements
- Proposed by Pryce in the wake of the Greystone Wharf arson
- **Audit began 21 Feb** — Six teams deployed across waterfront (Greystone Wharf to Harrowgate Pier). Coordinated by Fire Marshal Hale with Constabulary and Revenue Office. 72 vacant properties identified for review. 14 preliminary assessments completed on first day; at least 3 with lapsed fire safety certs, 2 with no documentation.

- **Falsified fire certificates** (22 Feb) — Day 2 of audit: two warehouses (Chandler's Row and Pilot's Alley) found with fire safety certificates bearing signatures of inspectors not employed at listed dates (2023–2025). Referred to Constabulary. 30 of 72 properties assessed. 5 lapsed certs, 2 with no documentation, 2 falsified, 3 with unauthorised habitation.

## Political Dynamics (updated)
