# Arts & Culture

## Visual Arts
- **Isolde Hargrove** — Born 1951, Dunbar's Reach. Reclusive painter, lives in Millhaven. Studied at Bobington Academy under Matthias Crane. Known for luminous landscapes (especially Greymoor Highlands) and intimate, unflinching portraits.
  - Graduation piece: "Morning, Ashford Bay" (1974), acquired by Royal Bobington Gallery
  - Subject of portrait: Tobias Renn, elderly Millhaven farmer (2018)
  - Retrospective "Light Through Glass" at Royal Bobington Gallery — 120+ works, opened 14 Feb 2026, runs through 30 June. Opening weekend: 8,000+ visitors. Admission: 8 florins (concessions 4, free Wednesdays). Made rare public appearance at opening.
  - **Art market surge** (18 Feb) — Advance bookings exceeded 22,000 through end of March (potentially most-attended exhibition in Gallery history, surpassing Matthias Crane memorial show of 2009). At least 3 private sales completed since opening. "November Light, Greymoor" (2011) sold privately for 45,000 florins (~triple its 2017 sale price). Auction houses Aldwyck & Horne (Port Caravel) and Maison Lefèvre (Verlaine) observed in Bobington meeting collectors. Gallery adding Friday/Saturday evening openings. Hargrove herself "thoroughly uninterested" in market activity (per Aldair).
  - **Hargrove letter** (19 Feb) — Hargrove sent a handwritten letter to Gallery Director Aldair, published with permission, decrying the "carnival of auction-house arithmetic" around her work. Key quote: "I painted the Greymoor hills because the light demanded to be seen. I did not paint for auction catalogues." Asked visitors to come for the paintings, not the prices. Letter delivered by unnamed elderly friend. Aldair responded warmly, confirmed no admission price increase. Gallery extending Wed evening openings beginning next week. Desmond Grayle noted the paradox: "Sincerity is the most effective marketing." Market frenzy expected to intensify, not abate. Hargrove has no plans for further public statements.
  - **Second weekend** (22-23 Feb) — ~14,000 visitors (nearly double opening weekend). Total attendance surpasses 30,000. Most-visited exhibition since Crane memorial 2009; on pace to surpass. Timed entry system announced beginning next week due to overwhelming demand. Queue on Saturday stretched from gallery steps along Arundel Crescent, past Royal Institute, around onto Mercer Street.
  - Gallery hours: 8 florins admission, concessions 4, free Wednesdays. Fri/Sat evening openings extended through March; Wed evening openings added from next week.
- **Matthias Crane** — Legendary painter, Hargrove's teacher, known for brooding seascapes

## Music

### Traditions & Genres
- **Resonance** — A musical tradition built around the twin-strung vielle. The instrument's two strings produce harmonic interference patterns (overtones) that create a "phantom" third voice. In skilled hands, an unaccompanied resonance performance can fill a concert hall. Thessarine in origin but practised widely.
- **Drift / Chamber-drift** — A genre combining vielle, bone flute, and bellows (a drone instrument). Emphasises layered tension and textural complexity. The Caulfield Ensemble from Edgeminster are rising stars.
- **Street-tone** — A vocal tradition from working-class Bobington, especially the Docklands. Group singing that builds harmonic towers from simple chants (stevedore's chants, river songs). Divisive but authentic. The Dockside Chorus are the leading practitioners.
- **Harmonic choir** — Verlainese choral tradition. Glacially beautiful.
- **Percussion** — Various traditions; the Adequate Badgers are a twelve-piece percussion troupe.

### Instruments
- **Vielle** — Twin-strung bowed instrument, central to resonance and drift music. Can be played melodically or for overtone/resonance work.
- **Bone flute** — Wind instrument used in chamber-drift.
- **Bellows** — Drone instrument, provides the low sustained tones in drift ensembles.

### Musicians
- **Luma Sable** — Resonance player (vielle), 41, Thessarine-born, Bobington-based. Transcendent solo performer. Standout of Windhallow 2026.
- **Celeste Caulfield** — Chamber-drift composer/performer, 28, from Edgeminster. Leads the Caulfield Ensemble.
- **Ivo Brennick** — Lead caller, Dockside Chorus (street-tone, Docklands).
- **The Adequate Badgers** — Twelve-piece percussion troupe.
- **Millgate Resonance Collective** — Resonance ensemble.

### Festivals
- **Windhallow Festival** — Annual music festival, Ashwater Valley (~12 km south of Bobington). 27th edition held Feb 2026. ~35,000 attendees over 3 days. Four stages (Ashwater Stage, River Stage, Woodland Stage, and a fourth). Director: Eamon Gallis.
