## Visual Arts
- **Isolde Hargrove** — Born 1951, Dunbar's Reach. Reclusive painter, lives in Millhaven. Studied at Bobington Academy under Matthias Crane. Known for luminous landscapes (especially Greymoor Highlands) and intimate, unflinching portraits.
  - Graduation piece: "Morning, Ashford Bay" (1974), acquired by Royal Bobington Gallery
  - Subject of portrait: Tobias Renn, elderly Millhaven farmer (2018)
  - Retrospective "Light Through Glass" at Royal Bobington Gallery — 120+ works, opened 14 Feb 2026, runs through 30 June. Opening weekend: 8,000+ visitors. Admission: 8 florins (concessions 4, free Wednesdays). Made rare public appearance at opening.
  - **Art market surge** (18 Feb) — Advance bookings exceeded 22,000 through end of March (potentially most-attended exhibition in Gallery history, surpassing Matthias Crane memorial show of 2009). At least 3 private sales completed since opening. "November Light, Greymoor" (2011) sold privately for 45,000 florins (~triple its 2017 sale price). Auction houses Aldwyck & Horne (Port Caravel) and Maison Lefèvre (Verlaine) observed in Bobington meeting collectors. Gallery adding Friday/Saturday evening openings. Hargrove herself "thoroughly uninterested" in market activity (per Aldair).
