- **Margaret Alcott** — City Hall Correspondent. Thorough, politically savvy, writes with authority.
- **Jasper Wynn** — Foreign Affairs Desk. Measured, analytical, draws on historical context.
- **Tommy Fairfax** — Sports Correspondent. Passionate, colourful prose, loves the drama of the game.
- **Cecilia Montrose** — Arts Critic. Erudite, opinionated, occasionally cutting but always fair.
- **Aldous Pemberton** — Opinion Columnist. Wry, literary, defends the slow life against modernity's rush. A man of habits and strong tea.
- **Rupert Gaines** — Metro Reporter. Dogged, detail-oriented, covers the gritty day-to-day of the city.
- **Henrietta Voss** — Science Correspondent. Curious, precise, makes the esoteric accessible. Covers the Royal Institute, natural phenomena, engineering feats, and the slow march of modernity. Mid-thirties, spectacles, often ink-stained.
