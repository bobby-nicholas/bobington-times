The Merchants' Guild of Bobington has not imposed a coordinated pricing framework on its members since the dockers' strike of 2011, and it did not do so lightly on Thursday. The vote, when it came, was unanimous — forty-three hands raised in a Guild Hall that has seen livelier debates over dock fees.

The emergency session, convened at ten o'clock under Guildmaster Hadrian Voss's chairmanship, lasted two hours and forty minutes and produced three substantive resolutions that amount to the most significant Guild intervention in commodity markets in fifteen years.

First: a Spice Crisis Committee of four — three merchants and one Guild officer — will coordinate a shared stockpile inventory, to be updated weekly, so that the remaining reserves across the city can be allocated rationally rather than hoarded competitively.

Second: an emergency pricing cap. No Guild member may charge more than two and a half times the pre-crisis price for any variety currently tracked by the Eastern Spice Index. The cap is voluntary — the Guild has no statutory enforcement power — but Voss made clear that non-compliance would carry consequences.

"Any merchant who profiteers from this crisis will find the Guild's doors closed to him," Voss said. "And the Guild's doors, I remind you, open onto a great deal of business that has nothing to do with spice."

Third: the formal presentation of the Guild's petition to the Foreign Office, requesting that spice trade routes be explicitly included in whatever diplomatic framework emerges from the Kaelmar quiet channel talks.

## The Petition

The petition, which has gathered sixty-seven signatures since its circulation last week — up from fifty-two on Wednesday — was presented by Voss himself. He walked it from Guild Hall to the Foreign Office on Chancery Row shortly after the session adjourned, accompanied by three Guild members including Haroun Nazari, the Ashbury Lane spice merchant whose family has traded since 1962.

The Foreign Office received the document through Undersecretary Helena Marchetti's office and issued a statement that was characteristically circumspect: "The Foreign Office is aware of the significant impact the Kaelmar disruption is having on Bobington's spice trade and related businesses. These concerns will be considered within the appropriate diplomatic framework."

Voss, who has six years' practice at interpreting official language, was cautiously satisfied. "That is not a 'no,'" he said. "And it is considerably more than we had a week ago."

## The Numbers

The Eastern Spice Index on the Bramblegate Exchange closed Thursday at 349 — down 7 points from Wednesday's record of 356. It was the first decline in thirteen trading days, and while the drop is modest, it reflects two things: the Guild's rationing announcement, which signals that the remaining supply will be managed rather than exhausted; and the broader diplomatic optimism following the confirmation of Bobington as venue for the Soren-Hale talks.

"The spice market has been pricing in chaos," said one Exchange floor trader who asked not to be named. "Today it priced in a little bit of order. That is not the same as pricing in a solution."

Nazari, whose warehouse on Ashbury Lane has been limiting purchases on eighteen of thirty-two varieties, said the rationing framework would allow him to maintain supply to existing restaurant clients through mid-March if the current rate of consumption holds.

"After that," he said, "it depends on the strait."

## Those Who Did Not Vote

The two merchants who have shuttered their businesses — Hamid Rassam of Ashbury Lane and Elia Thorne of Chandler's Row — were not present. Thorne closed rather than charge crisis prices to dockworkers' families. Rassam exhausted his stock of black cardamon and velveroot.

Their absence was noted by several members, including one who said, quietly, that the rationing framework had come too late for the smallest traders.

Voss acknowledged this in his closing remarks. "We should have acted sooner," he said. "We are acting now."

The Spice Crisis Committee will hold its first meeting on Monday. The shared stockpile inventory is expected to be completed by Wednesday. The Foreign Office, presumably, will take its own time.
