For the second week running, merchant vessels arriving at Bobington's Port Sovereign have carried troubling reports from the Kaelmar Strait, the narrow and strategically vital waterway separating the Delvarian Empire from the islands of the Thessarine Confederation.

Captain Runa Halverssen of the cargo brig *Windhaven*, which docked early Wednesday morning carrying a hold full of Thessarine copper, described passing no fewer than eleven Delvarian warships anchored in formation near the strait's northern passage.

"I've sailed those waters for twenty years," Halverssen told reporters gathered at the harbormaster's office. "I've never seen anything like it. They weren't moving. Just sitting there, watching."

## A Dispute Decades Old

The Kaelmar Strait has been a flashpoint between the two nations since the Treaty of Ashen Bluffs divided the waterway in 1987, granting the Delvarians control of the northern channel and the Thessarines the southern. Both sides have long accused the other of encroachments, but outright military posturing of this scale is rare.

Delvarian state newspapers, which arrived in Bobington via the weekly diplomatic pouch, describe the naval presence as "routine exercises" and dismiss foreign concern as "the anxious chatter of those who do not understand the sea."

The Thessarine ambassador to Bobington, Consul Elara Miren, offered a sharply different assessment during a hastily arranged press briefing at the consulate on Ashbury Lane.

"Routine exercises do not require eleven warships," Miren said. "The Confederation has formally requested that the Delvarian government clarify its intentions through the proper diplomatic channels. We await their response."

## Bobington's Stake

The strait is of considerable economic importance to Bobington. Roughly a third of the city's copper imports and nearly half its eastern spice trade pass through the Kaelmar passage. Any disruption to shipping could send commodity prices soaring at the Bramblegate Exchange, where copper futures have already climbed eight percent since the reports began.

The Bobington Foreign Office has thus far limited its response to a carefully worded statement urging "all parties to pursue dialogue and respect the established boundaries of international maritime law."

Whether that restrained posture will hold may depend on developments in the coming days. The Thessarine Navy, while considerably smaller than its Delvarian counterpart, has begun recalling reservists to its island garrisons — a step that analysts regard as precautionary but significant.
