It took sixty-three years, four parliamentary motions, two rejected designs, and the quiet, unyielding persistence of a woman named Bess Holloway — but the miners of Dunvale will have their memorial.

The National Parliament in Caldwell voted on Friday to approve 2.1 million florins for the construction of a permanent memorial at the site of the Greymoor mining disaster of 1963, in which 41 men were killed when a series of underground collapses sealed the Dunvale No. 3 shaft during the night shift of 14 March.

The vote was 312 to 7, with 14 abstentions. Several parliamentarians wept.

"This is not a victory," said Holloway, now 81, the widow of shift foreman Arthur Holloway, who was among the dead. She spoke to reporters by telephone from her home in Greymoor. "A victory would have been better timber bracing in 1963. This is an acknowledgement. It will do."

## The Disaster

The Dunvale No. 3 collapse remains the deadliest industrial accident in the nation's peacetime history. On the night of 14 March 1963, a section of the main gallery — weakened, investigators later determined, by inadequate shoring and the extraction of a neighbouring seam without sufficient pillar support — gave way at approximately 2:15 AM. The initial collapse triggered a chain of secondary failures that sealed the shaft at three separate points.

Rescue teams worked for eleven days. They reached the first group of survivors — seven men sheltering in an air pocket near the ventilation crosscut — on the fourth day. They found the last body on the twenty-second.

The subsequent inquiry, led by Chief Mining Inspector Roderick Hallam, found that Dunvale Mineral Holdings had failed to reinforce the No. 3 gallery despite warnings from company geologists. Three company directors were prosecuted; one was convicted. The mine closed permanently in 1964.

The disaster led directly to the Mining Safety Reform Act of 1965, which established the independent Inspectorate of Mines and mandated quarterly structural assessments of all active shafts — regulations that remain in force today and are credited with a seventy per cent reduction in underground fatalities over the following two decades.

## The Memorial

The approved design is the work of Ines Cavallo, a sculptor from Port Caravel who has spent much of the past decade working in Bobington. Cavallo's proposal, selected from forty-one submissions — one for each miner killed — depicts forty-one bronze figures ascending a staircase carved into the granite of the pithead itself. The figures range from stooped to upright, and the staircase leads, deliberately, nowhere.

"They are not arriving," Cavallo said in her submission statement. "They are leaving. That is the point. They left for work and did not come back."

The memorial will be erected at the Dunvale pithead, which has stood derelict since the mine's closure. The Greymoor Highlands Council has agreed to maintain the site as a public park. Construction is expected to begin in spring and conclude by autumn.

## "About Bloody Time"

Holloway has campaigned for a memorial since 1968, when she hand-delivered her first petition — 2,300 signatures gathered door to door in Greymoor — to the parliamentary office in Caldwell. She was twenty-three years old.

She was told there was no budget. She was told again in 1974, 1989, and 2004 — the years in which the previous parliamentary motions failed, variously, on grounds of cost, design disagreements, and what one minister described, with remarkable candour, as "memorial fatigue."

"I don't know what 'memorial fatigue' is," Holloway told the Greymoor Herald in 2004. "I know what widow fatigue is. I'll outlast them."

She did.

The Miners' Cooperative of Greymoor — the organisation now chaired by Nils Haversten, which represents the small-scale copper operations that are the Highlands' remaining mining industry — issued a statement welcoming the vote and noting that fourteen of the forty-one men killed in 1963 were direct forebears of current cooperative members.

"The copper in these hills has a price," the statement read. "So does the memory of the men who dug it. We are glad Parliament has finally agreed to pay."
