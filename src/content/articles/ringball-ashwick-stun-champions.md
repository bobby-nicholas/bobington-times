They were dead at three-quarter time. The scoreboard said so. The Harriers' bench said so. Ashwick's own supporters, streaming toward the exits with the weary resignation of people who have watched their team lose from promising positions before, said so — or at least their feet did.

Then Fen Barlow caught the third-quarter drop and everything changed.

The Ashwick Stoneflies beat the Caravel Harriers 34-29 at a disbelieving Ashwick Oval on Saturday afternoon, scoring three rings in the final quarter to overturn an eight-point deficit and end the defending champions' unbeaten run at twenty-three matches. It was, by any measure, absurd.

"I don't know what happened," said Stoneflies keeper Maren Thatch, who made six clearances in the final quarter alone. "Somewhere around the fifty-minute mark the whole ground just — tilted. You could feel it."

## A Masterclass Undone

For three quarters, the Harriers had been magnificent. Their cornerwork was precise, their lodge rotation seamless, and their centrist, Oska Dain — arguably the finest player in the league — was conducting proceedings with the languid authority of someone who has seen every angle before and is mildly bored by all of them.

Dain scored the afternoon's first ring with a sweeping arc from the left lodge that bent around two Stoneflies markers and dropped through the hoop with the sound that 14,000 people heard and none of them liked. The Harriers added two more before the Stoneflies managed their first — a scrambled effort from close range by lock Petra Venn that the Caravel keeper probably should have stopped.

At the main interval, it was 17-9 to the visitors. At three-quarter time, 27-19. The Harriers were playing keep-lodge with the ease of a team that has won back-to-back titles and sees no reason to stop.

## The Barlow Quarter

What followed will be replayed on gramophones and in pubs for years.

Fen Barlow — twenty-two years old, playing only her ninth senior match — caught the third-quarter drop cleanly, pivoted past Dain (a sentence that does not appear often in ringball reporting), and drove a flat arc from thirty metres that hit the inside of the ring and spun through. The Oval erupted. The people who had been leaving stopped leaving.

Barlow scored again four minutes later, this time from the right lodge after a passing sequence involving six Stoneflies players that was so fluid it looked choreographed. It was not. "We don't have the budget for choreography," said Stoneflies coach Regan Hollister afterward, entirely straight-faced.

The third ring — the one that broke the Harriers — came from veteran centrist Dov Marsden, who at thirty-six was supposed to be managing his minutes, not launching arcs from the centreline. The ring floated for what felt like a geological age before dropping through with such perfection that even the Caravel supporters applauded.

Thirty-two to twenty-seven. Seven minutes remaining. The Harriers, for the first time all season, looked rattled.

Venn added a close-range ring with three minutes left. The Harriers managed a late consolation through Dain — because Dain always scores — but the damage was done.

## The Table

The result leaves the Ringball League title race deliciously open. Caravel remain top on 47 points, but the Thornbury Lancers — who beat Millhaven 26-18 on Saturday — are now just two points behind, with the Stoneflies a further point back in third. Six rounds remain.

"Twenty-three matches," said Harriers coach Wil Sørensen, with the expression of a man performing arithmetic he does not enjoy. "You'd think that would be enough of a buffer. It isn't."

The Stoneflies host the Lancers next Saturday in what now looks like a pivotal fixture. Barlow will start. After today, it would be unwise to suggest otherwise.
