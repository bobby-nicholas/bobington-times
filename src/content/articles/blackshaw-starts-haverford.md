summary: "Orin Blackshaw will start at centre-back when Bobington Rovers face Haverford Town at Bridgewater Stadium on Saturday afternoon, manager Phillipa Corbett confirmed after the defender completed a full training session without restriction on Friday. A sellout crowd of 48,000 — the first league sellout this season — will watch a side that won the Merchants' Cup seven days ago attempt to claw its way out of the relegation places."

The knee is fit. The man is ready. Orin Blackshaw, whose right-footed equaliser against Ironhall United a week ago turned the Merchants' Cup final on its hinge, and whose subsequent ligament strain has dominated the city's sporting conversation ever since, will start at centre-back against Haverford Town on Saturday.

Manager Phillipa Corbett confirmed as much on Friday evening after Blackshaw completed a full training session at the Thornhill ground — the session that Dr. Lena Sorrens, the club physiotherapist, had designated as the decisive test. "He trained fully," Corbett said, with the air of someone who has spent the week answering the same question four hundred times. "He'll start. That's the end of it."

Those who watched the session described Blackshaw as moving without visible discomfort through the full range of contact drills: aerial challenges, sliding tackles, the explosive changes of direction that are the currency of Premier Division defending. One observer, a club staff member who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to describe training sessions to newspapers, said simply: "He moved like himself."

## The Eleven

Corbett named an unchanged side from the cup final, with one exception: Nadia Osei, who started on the bench against Ironhall due to hamstring tightness, returns to the right wing in place of Theo Harwick. The young academy graduate, who acquitted himself well enough in the final, drops to the substitutes' bench.

The full starting eleven: Marsh; Kellaway, Blackshaw, Cahill, Torrence; Dunmore, Whitaker, Brennick; Osei, Harte, Volkov.

Ronan Cahill, the veteran who would have partnered Harwick had Blackshaw failed Friday's test, retains his place alongside the man whose availability makes his own selection less remarkable but no less essential. Cahill has survived two previous relegation campaigns with Rovers. He does not require reminders about what Saturday means.

## The Stakes

Bobington Rovers sit fifteenth in the Premier Division table with twenty-six points from twenty-four matches, three points above the relegation places and fourteen matches remaining. The arithmetic is not complicated. The margin for error is slender, and the euphoria of the cup — the parade, the two hundred thousand, Caldecott Square singing Dunmore's name — is precisely the kind of intoxicant that can blur the edges of a survival campaign.

Corbett, who has spent the week attempting to refocus a club that spent Tuesday riding an open-top tram through the city centre, was characteristically blunt: "Saturday is the start of something completely separate. The cup is on the mantelpiece. The league is on the pitch. If we confuse the two, we are in serious trouble."

## The Visitors

Haverford Town arrive in thirteenth place with twenty-nine points, three ahead of Rovers — comfortable enough by points but not by temperament. Dai Llewellyn's side have won two of their last three away fixtures and conceded only four goals in those matches, making them the meanest travelling defence in the bottom half. Llewellyn, who played for Rovers as a young man before his career took him elsewhere, has shown no sentimentality in his pre-match comments. "Cup form and league form are different animals," he said on Thursday. "We go to Bridgewater to win."

Haverford's discipline is their weapon: a compact, low block that surrenders territory willingly and punishes teams on the counterattack. They will sit deep, absorb pressure, and wait for Rovers to overcommit. Against a side whose cup triumph was built on attacking verve and emotional intensity, Llewellyn's tactical patience could prove maddening.

## Elsewhere

Millwall Athletic, who occupy the final relegation place with twenty-three points, travel to Thornbury Academicals — third in the table and formidable at home. A Millwall defeat combined with a Rovers victory would open a six-point cushion between the two sides and represent the most breathing room Corbett's team has enjoyed all season. A Rovers defeat and a Millwall win would see them swap places. The permutations are not kind to the nerves.

## The Atmosphere

The 48,000 tickets sold make Saturday the first league sellout at Bridgewater this season. The Transit Authority has scheduled additional tram services from the Docklands and Upper Fernwich, mindful of the lessons learned — and the 380,000 passengers carried — during Tuesday's parade.

What those 48,000 will see is a team caught between two realities: the version of Bobington Rovers that lifted the Merchants' Cup seven nights ago, and the version that has won four of twenty-four league matches this season. Corbett must find a way to bottle the first without ignoring the second.

Kickoff is at three o'clock.
