summary: "All four suspension cables on the 112-year-old Fernwick Bridge show stress fractures, engineers from Hallam & Stroud confirmed Monday — not three, as initially reported. The repair timeline has stretched to eight to twelve months, with costs estimated at 55 to 65 million florins. Chief Municipal Engineer Dorothea Kinnear called an emergency meeting to discuss an Ashwater ferry service for the 14,000 daily commuters left without their crossing."

The news from Fernwick Bridge is worse than anyone expected.

When Chief Municipal Engineer Dorothea Kinnear ordered the bridge closed on Friday after stress fractures were discovered in three of its four suspension cables, there was cautious hope that the fourth cable — the northeastern span — remained sound. A weekend of intensive assessment by Hallam & Stroud, the engineering consultancy that reinforced the nearby Coldharbour Viaduct in 2019, has extinguished that hope.

"All four primary suspension cables show micro-fractures consistent with long-term fatigue failure," said Malcolm Stroud, the firm's senior partner, in a preliminary report delivered to the Municipal Works Office on Monday morning. "The bridge is structurally compromised in a manner that precludes any safe resumption of traffic without comprehensive cable replacement."

The bridge, which opened in 1914 and carries approximately 14,000 commuters daily between Thornhill and Bramblegate, has been closed since Friday afternoon. The barriers and warning signs that went up hastily three days ago now appear likely to remain for the better part of a year.

## The Scale of the Problem

Stroud's report details the nature of the failure with a precision that, for the layperson, is both illuminating and unsettling. The bridge's original cables — four bundles of high-carbon steel wire, each approximately thirty centimetres in diameter — were designed for a sixty-year service life. They have been in continuous use for one hundred and twelve years.

Periodic inspections over the decades detected gradual degradation, and the cables were reinforced with supplementary wire wrapping in 1968 and again in 1991. But the core wires — the original structural heart of each cable — have been slowly weakening for decades. Friday's discovery of fractures in three cables prompted the emergency closure. Stroud's weekend examination of the fourth cable, using electromagnetic testing equipment loaned by the Bobington Polytechnic, revealed fractures that were not yet visible to the eye but clearly present to the instruments.

"The surprise is not that the cables are failing," Stroud told this correspondent. "The surprise is that they lasted as long as they did. This is a tribute to the original engineering. But a tribute is not a load-bearing structure."

Repair will require the complete replacement of all four cable assemblies — a process Stroud estimates at eight to twelve months from the commencement of work, at a cost of 55 to 65 million florins. The estimate assumes no complications with the bridge's anchorages or towers, which have yet to be fully assessed.

## 14,000 Commuters Stranded

The human cost is immediate and considerable. Fernwick Bridge is the primary crossing between Thornhill — a largely residential district — and the Bramblegate market and commercial district. The alternative crossings are limited: Coldharbour Viaduct, north of Fernwick, is already operating at an estimated 140 per cent of its designed traffic capacity. The Lower Ashwater Footbridge accommodates pedestrians only. The Millgate tram bridge carries tram traffic and is not open to motor vehicles.

Kinnear convened an emergency meeting Monday afternoon with Transit Authority officials and the Municipal Works Office to discuss temporary measures. The leading proposal is an emergency ferry service across the Ashwater, operating from temporary jetties at Thornhill Reach and Bramblegate Steps.

"We are examining the feasibility of a motor ferry running at fifteen-minute intervals during peak hours," Kinnear said. "Capacity would be limited — perhaps two hundred passengers per crossing — but it would relieve the most acute pressure on the Coldharbour route."

The cost of establishing such a service — procuring or leasing suitable vessels, constructing jetties, hiring crew — is estimated at 800,000 to 1.2 million florins. Funding would come from the municipal emergency infrastructure reserve, which is already under strain from the tramway cost overrun.

Estelle Danforth, a bookkeeper who commutes daily from Thornhill to Upper Fernwich, captured the frustration of many: "They've been talking about the tramway for eight years. Meanwhile, the bridge we actually use is falling apart. Where are the priorities?"

## An Age of Infrastructure Reckoning

Fernwick Bridge is not the only ageing structure in the city's portfolio. The Municipal Works Office maintains a register of over four hundred bridges, viaducts, tunnels, and retaining walls across Bobington, many dating to the same era of Victorian-age engineering. Kinnear has previously warned — in annual reports that attracted little attention — that deferred maintenance across the network carries compounding risk.

"Fernwick is the bridge that broke," Stroud observed. "It is not the only bridge that is old."

The timing, with the Copper Review Commission debating a multi-billion-florin tramway expansion, has not escaped notice. Councilman Voss, who has long argued that basic infrastructure maintenance should take priority over ambitious new projects, raised the Fernwick closure during Monday's commission hearing as evidence that the city's fiscal capacity is already overextended.

Repairs are expected to begin within four to six weeks, pending the completion of detailed design work and the procurement of cable materials. The cable steel, Stroud noted, is a specialised alloy that may itself be subject to supply pressures — though not, mercifully, dependent on copper.

In the meantime, Fernwick Bridge stands where it has stood since 1914: graceful, Victorian, and closed. The river flows beneath it. The commuters find another way.
