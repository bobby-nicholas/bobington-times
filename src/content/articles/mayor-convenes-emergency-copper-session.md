Mayor Harriet Blackthorne announced on Monday afternoon that she has convened an emergency session of the City Council for Wednesday to address the budgetary impact of the Kaelmar Strait crisis on the city's infrastructure programme, with particular attention to the Veridan Corridor Tramway Expansion.

The special session, to be held in the Municipal Chamber at ten o'clock, will hear testimony from Chief Transit Engineer Yara Okonkwo, representatives of the Bobington Merchants' Guild, and officials from the Municipal Treasury. Blackthorne described the session as "a necessary and prudent step to ensure that the Council has a full and accurate picture of the fiscal landscape before us."

"When we approved the tramway expansion ten days ago, copper was trading at 740 florins per tonne," Blackthorne said in a statement. "It is now above 840. The Council and the public deserve to know what that means for the project's timeline and budget, and what options are available to us."

## The Numbers

The numbers, according to preliminary estimates obtained by the Times, are sobering.

The Veridan Corridor Tramway Expansion was approved on 5 February with a total budget of 3.2 billion florins, of which approximately 380 million florins was allocated for copper and copper-alloy components — overhead catenary wire, electrical distribution systems, signal cabling, and decorative fixtures for the twelve planned stations.

At the time of the vote, those estimates were based on a copper price of approximately 740 florins per tonne. At Monday's closing price of 843 florins, that copper allocation would need to increase by an estimated 45 million florins. But engineers and procurement officials warned that the true exposure is considerably larger, because the city has not yet locked in supply contracts and prices could rise further if the Kaelmar crisis persists.

"If copper reaches 900 florins and stays there through the contracting period, which begins this summer, we could be looking at an overrun of 380 to 420 million florins on copper-dependent components alone," said a senior official in the Transit Authority who spoke on condition of anonymity. "That doesn't include secondary effects — contractors adjusting their bids upward to account for material volatility, for example."

Chief Transit Engineer Okonkwo declined to comment ahead of Wednesday's session but confirmed through a spokesperson that her office was "preparing a comprehensive briefing for the Council on material costs, supply chain risks, and potential mitigation strategies."

## "We Told You So"

Councilman Aldric Voss, who voted against the tramway expansion and has consistently argued that the city is overextending itself on infrastructure at the expense of schools and emergency services, was characteristically forthright.

"This is precisely what I warned about," Voss said. "We committed 3.2 billion florins to a project that hadn't secured a single supply contract, in a world where commodity prices can move fifteen per cent in a weekend. I take no pleasure in being vindicated, but the Council needs to face the reality that this project, as currently scoped, may not be affordable."

Voss stopped short of calling for the tramway to be cancelled but said the Council should "seriously consider" scaling back the project — potentially eliminating stations, reducing the route length, or delaying Phase 2 — to bring costs within the original budget.

Councilwoman Ida Pryce, the tramway's most vocal champion, pushed back firmly.

"Aldric Voss has never met a public investment he wouldn't try to kill," Pryce said. "The Kaelmar situation is a temporary crisis. Copper prices will stabilise. The tramway is a thirty-year investment in this city's future, and we are not going to gut it because of a few weeks of volatility in the commodities market."

Pryce argued that the city should instead accelerate the procurement timeline, locking in contracts now before prices climb further, and explore the use of Greymoor-sourced copper from domestic mines to reduce dependence on imported material.

## Domestic Copper

The question of domestic supply is not straightforward. Bobington's nearest significant copper deposits are in the Greymoor Highlands, approximately 180 kilometres to the north-east, where several small mining operations extract ore primarily for the jewellery and artisanal trades. These operations, according to the Miners' Cooperative of Greymoor, produce roughly 2,000 tonnes annually — a fraction of the estimated 12,000 tonnes the tramway project alone would require over its four-year construction period.

"We're a cottage industry being asked to supply a cathedral," said Nils Haversten, chairman of the Cooperative. "Could we scale up? In theory. But you're talking about new shafts, new equipment, new workers — an investment of tens of millions of florins that would take eighteen months to two years to bring online. And if the Kaelmar crisis resolves next month and copper drops back to 700, we'd be left holding the bill."

## The Wednesday Session

The emergency session is expected to be contentious. Council Speaker Desmond Falk confirmed that the session will be open to the public and that the gallery in the Municipal Chamber will be available on a first-come, first-served basis.

"The Mayor and the Council are committed to full transparency on this matter," Falk said. "These are public funds and a public project, and the public has every right to hear the discussion."

The tramway expansion, which would run fourteen miles from the Docklands to Upper Fernwich via Midtown, with twelve stations and a major interchange at Caldecott Square, was approved by a vote of 7-4 on 5 February after nearly a decade of advocacy by Pryce and the moderniser faction on the Council. Phase 1 was scheduled to break ground in autumn of this year.

Whether that timeline survives the week may depend on what Okonkwo tells the Council on Wednesday — and on what happens next in the Kaelmar Strait.
