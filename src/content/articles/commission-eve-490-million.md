Written submissions from the Merchants' Guild, the Docklands Workers' Association, and the Historical Preservation Society reveal sharply divergent priorities.

By Monday morning at nine o'clock, the Municipal Chamber will be the most consequential room in Bobington.

The Copper Review Commission — established nine days ago by an unusual unanimous vote, co-chaired by two politicians who agree on almost nothing, and tasked with determining the fate of the city's largest infrastructure project in a generation — holds its first public hearing. Chief Transit Engineer Yara Okonkwo will present her technical assessment. Deputy Treasurer Annabel Whitford will lay out the fiscal picture. Nils Haversten of the Miners' Cooperative of Greymoor will speak to domestic copper supply. And in the public gallery, more than two hundred dockworkers plan to watch every word.

The commission has nine days to deliver its report. By any measure, this is an unreasonable timetable for a decision involving hundreds of millions of florins. But copper is not waiting, the city's credit rating is not waiting, and the six thousand workers who were promised construction jobs beginning in the autumn are certainly not waiting.

## Saturday's Preparations

Councilwoman Pryce and Councilman Voss met privately on Saturday morning in the Municipal Chamber to review procedures and examine the written submissions that had arrived during the week. Aides described the meeting as "businesslike" — a word that, when applied to this particular pairing, counts as warmth.

The two co-chairs are a study in contrasts that has been well documented in these pages. Pryce, the Docklands councillor who championed the tramway for eight years, has the most to gain from a decision to proceed and the most to lose from a delay. Voss, the fiscal conservative who voted against the original tramway authorisation, has never hidden his view that the project was over-ambitious and undercosted. That they are co-chairing the same commission is either a masterwork of institutional design or a slow-burning catastrophe. Speaker Falk's assessment — "either inspired or catastrophic" — has not yet been definitively answered.

What is clear is that both are taking the mandate seriously. Neither has made public statements this week. Neither has briefed favoured reporters. The silence is either discipline or deadlock.

## The Written Submissions

Three formal written submissions were filed with the commission before Saturday's deadline, and they reveal the breadth of the interests at stake.

**The Merchants' Guild**, represented by Guildmaster Hadrian Voss — no relation to the councillor — submitted a twelve-page analysis of the Kaelmar crisis's impact on commercial shipping. The Guild warns that sustained disruption could add fifteen to twenty-two per cent to the landed cost of eastern goods, and urges the commission to proceed with the tramway but consider "modified scope" to reduce copper dependency. The Guild explicitly opposes cancellation, noting that the tramway would "fundamentally reshape Bobington's commercial infrastructure for the better part of a century."

**The Docklands Workers' Association**, through foreman Patrick Seldon, filed a five-page submission focused almost entirely on labour protections. The DWA demands guaranteed wages for the six thousand tramway construction workers regardless of project delays or redesigns, and calls for the commission to include workforce impact in its evaluation criteria. Seldon's submission notes that "the men and women who will build this tramway have already left other employment on the strength of promises made by this council."

**The Bobington Historical Preservation Society**, chaired by Louisa Marchbank, submitted a characteristically detailed argument for the retention of Greymoor granite facades at all twelve stations. The Society opposes any redesign that would substitute cheaper materials for aesthetic reasons, describing the granite facades as "an investment in civic permanence that will be judged not in years but in generations."

## The Gallery

Seldon confirmed on Saturday that more than two hundred members of the Docklands Workers' Association plan to attend Monday's hearing. The Municipal Chamber's public gallery holds approximately three hundred. The remaining seats will be available to the public on a first-come basis, and aides expect queues from early morning.

"We're not there to shout," Seldon said when reached at his Docklands home on Saturday evening. "We're there to be seen. The council needs to look at the people whose livelihoods depend on this decision and make it with open eyes."

The DWA's presence is a political fact that the commission cannot ignore. Seldon has emerged over the past week as the most prominent working-class voice in Bobington's political conversation — a position he did not seek and shows no sign of relinquishing.

## The Numbers

The arithmetic has not changed since Okonkwo's presentation to the emergency council session, but it has worsened. At Friday's copper close of 886 florins per tonne — a twelve-year high — the estimated overrun on the tramway's copper components stands at approximately 490 million florins. Analyst Clement Varga of Fernwich Trading House maintains his forecast of 900 to 910 by the end of the coming week if the Kaelmar Strait remains disrupted.

The city's capital contingency reserve stands at 142 million florins. The gap between what is available and what may be needed is, to put it delicately, significant.

Okonkwo's three options remain on the table: proceed and absorb the overrun through long-term bonds (approximately 28 million per year for twenty years); redesign with aluminium substitution (reducing copper dependency by thirty per cent but delaying the project by eighteen months); or phase the construction, building only Phase 1 and deferring Phase 2 until prices stabilise.

Cancellation would cost an estimated 180 million in termination penalties.

## The Silence

Mayor Harriet Blackthorne has made no public statement on the commission, the tramway, or the copper crisis since the commission was established on 19 February. Her office has declined multiple requests for comment. In a city where the mayor has historically relished the centre of any political stage, the silence is conspicuous.

Whether it reflects strategic prudence — allowing the commission to work without mayoral interference — or political paralysis is a question that Monday's hearing may begin to answer.

The Municipal Chamber opens at eight o'clock. The hearing begins at nine. By the end of the day, Bobington will know what its options sound like when spoken aloud. The harder question — what to do about them — will occupy the eight days that follow.
