There are ringball matches and there are ringball matches. Saturday's fixture at Ashwick Oval belongs in the second category.

The Ashwick Stoneflies, third on forty-four points, host the Thornbury Lancers, second on forty-five, in a match that will reshape the title picture with five rounds remaining after this weekend. The Caravel Harriers, whose twenty-three-match unbeaten run was ended by these same Stoneflies a week ago, sit on forty-seven points and have a bye.

Which means the Harriers will be watching. And what they see will matter.

A Stoneflies victory would lift them to forty-seven — level with Caravel and just two behind the Lancers should they drop to forty-five. A Lancers win would take them to forty-eight, one clear of Caravel at the top of the table for the first time this season. A draw would change nothing and everything, leaving all three teams within three points with the final straight approaching.

Coach Regan Hollister, whose Stoneflies have transformed from respectable mid-table side to genuine contenders in the space of six weeks, was characteristically direct.

"We don't control what Caravel do," Hollister said. "We control what happens on our oval, in front of our people. That's enough to think about."

## The Matchups

The tactical intrigue centres on the contrast between two styles. The Lancers under their methodical approach — patient centrework, low-risk arcs, the league's best defensive record — will meet a Stoneflies side that thrives on intensity, transition, and the capacity of twenty-two-year-old Fen Barlow to find angles that more experienced players cannot imagine.

Barlow, who scored twice in the Stoneflies' 34-29 victory over Caravel last Saturday, has been the breakout story of the ringball season. In nine senior matches he has scored eleven rings — a rate that has drawn comparisons, inevitably, to the young Oska Dain.

"Comparisons to Dain are flattering but irrelevant," said Hollister. "Fen is his own player. He's fast, he's brave, and he sees the ring when it's not obvious. That's enough."

Against him will be the disciplined marking of the Lancers' defensive structure and the orchestrating intelligence of Jens Aldric at centrist. Aldric, twenty-eight, a six-year veteran, leads the league in assists and plays the game as though he has already read tomorrow's match report.

"Aldric doesn't beat you with speed," said veteran Stoneflies centrist Dov Marsden, who at thirty-six has seen most things on a ringball oval. "He beats you with timing. You think you've read the play, and then the ball is somewhere you didn't expect, and someone you didn't see is scoring."

Marsden himself will be a factor. His centreline ring against Caravel last Saturday was the composed act of a man who has spent a decade and a half learning where the ring is, and his experience will be crucial in managing the match's rhythm.

## The Ground

Ashwick Oval will be full. Fourteen thousand are expected — a capacity crowd for a ground that was, five years ago, routinely a quarter empty on Saturday afternoons. The Stoneflies' ascent has been as much a civic event as a sporting one.

Keeper Maren Thatch, whose six clearances in the final quarter against Caravel were instrumental in holding the lead, spoke about the atmosphere.

"When this ground is full, it moves," Thatch said. "The noise comes down from the stands and it pushes you. There's no way to explain it to someone who hasn't stood in the keeper's arc with fourteen thousand people behind you."

The Lancers, who boast the league's best away record — seven wins from ten — are not a side easily rattled. But Ashwick Oval on a Saturday afternoon, with the title implications of this match, represents a different order of test.

First drop at two o'clock.
