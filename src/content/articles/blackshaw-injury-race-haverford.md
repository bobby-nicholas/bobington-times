summary: "Orin Blackshaw's right knee injury has been assessed as a ligament strain rather than a tear, giving the Rovers centre-back a chance of featuring in Saturday's crucial relegation clash against Haverford Town — but manager Phillipa Corbett said the decision would go to the wire. Nadia Osei trained lightly on Wednesday and is more optimistic about her hamstring. The match is a confirmed sellout, the first in the league this season."

The morning after a cup parade tends to feel like the morning after a wedding — all the joy and none of the energy. The Rovers' training ground at Thornhill, which had been given over to celebrations and media duties for the better part of two days, returned to its primary function on Wednesday with an air of purposeful sobriety.

Fourteen league matches remain. The Rovers are fifteenth, three points above the trapdoor. And two of their most important players arrived at training with the question marks still attached.

## Blackshaw: Strain, Not Tear

The most anxious vigil concerned Orin Blackshaw, whose headed equaliser in the cup final changed the course of the match and whose right knee, visibly bandaged throughout Tuesday's parade, has been the subject of fevered speculation since he was seen limping heavily at the Caldecott Square ceremony.

Club physiotherapist Dr. Lena Sorrens conducted a thorough assessment on Wednesday morning, and the verdict — relayed to the press by manager Phillipa Corbett with the careful diction of someone choosing her words for legal as well as medical reasons — offered a sliver of hope.

"The scan shows a grade-one ligament strain," Corbett said. "Not a tear. That's the good news. The less good news is that it's Wednesday and we play Saturday, and grade one doesn't mean pain-free. He'll do light work tomorrow. If he comes through that, he trains Friday. If he comes through that, he plays. It's a day-by-day decision."

Blackshaw himself, emerging from the physio room with his knee in a compression sleeve, was characteristically terse. "Feels better than yesterday. Felt terrible yesterday. So that's a low bar."

Asked whether he would play on Saturday, he said: "You'd have to tie me to a chair to keep me out. But it's not my call."

## Osei: Cautious Optimism

The news on Nadia Osei's hamstring was more encouraging. The winger, whose explosive acceleration created the space for Kael Dunmore's cup-winning strike, had not trained at all on Monday and was visibly guarded during Tuesday's parade. But she joined the squad for a light session on Wednesday afternoon and emerged smiling.

"Bit tight first ten minutes, then it loosened up," Osei told reporters. "I did some sprints at the end — seventy, eighty per cent. Felt good. Bit tight. But good."

Corbett was cautious but less guarded than she had been about Blackshaw. "Nadia's ahead of where I expected her to be. She'll train fully tomorrow. If there's no setback, she's available for selection."

The contrast in the two players' conditions presents Corbett with different tactical puzzles. Osei's pace on the right flank is integral to the Rovers' counter-attacking threat, but there are capable deputies on the bench. Blackshaw's absence would be harder to cover. The centre-back's reading of the game and aerial dominance have been the foundation of a defence that, for all the team's struggles, has conceded fewer goals than any side in the bottom six.

## Corbett's Contingency

Should Blackshaw fail to recover, Corbett's options are limited. Ronan Cahill, the veteran defender who has survived two previous relegation scrapes with the club, is the most experienced alternative but has started only four matches this season. Young Theo Harwick, a twenty-year-old academy graduate, featured in two cup matches earlier in the campaign and acquitted himself well, but Saturday's match carries a weight that youth and promise alone may not bear.

"I have plans for every scenario," Corbett said, in a tone that suggested she was not inclined to share them. "The squad knows what's at stake. We won't be using the cup as an excuse."

## Sellout Confirmed

Bridgewater Stadium will be full on Saturday. The club confirmed on Wednesday evening that the final tickets had been sold, making it the first league sellout at the 48,000-capacity ground this season. The previous highest league attendance was 39,200 for the opening-day defeat to Caravel City.

The cup run — and particularly the extraordinary scenes of Tuesday's parade — has clearly rekindled a connection between the club and a city that had grown weary of mid-table mediocrity and relegation anxiety. Whether that energy can translate into the kind of atmosphere that lifts a team in a desperate fight remains to be seen.

"Forty-eight thousand people singing your name is worth a goal start," said Sully Marsh, the captain, when asked about the sellout. "But you've still got to put the ball in the net yourself. Haverford won't care how many scarves are in the stands."

## The Opponent

Haverford Town arrive at Bridgewater in thirteenth place on 29 points, three clear of the Rovers but far from safe themselves. Manager Dai Llewellyn, speaking to reporters at Haverford's training ground on Wednesday, was politely unimpressed by the suggestion that the Rovers' cup heroics made them favourites.

"Cup form and league form are different animals," Llewellyn said. "They're fifteenth for a reason. A parade doesn't change that. My lads are focused, fit, and not remotely intimidated."

Haverford have won two of their last three away matches and boast one of the division's meanest travelling defences. They will not be overawed by the occasion.

## The Table

The bottom of the Premier Division heading into the weekend:

| Pos | Team | P | Pts |
|-----|------|---|-----|
| 13 | Haverford Town | 24 | 29 |
| 14 | Ashwick Borough | 24 | 27 |
| 15 | **Bobington Rovers** | **24** | **26** |
| 16 | Duncastle FC | 24 | 25 |
| 17 | Millwall Athletic | 24 | 23 |

Millwall, who occupy the final relegation place, travel to third-placed Thornbury Academicals on Saturday. A Millwall defeat and a Rovers victory would open a six-point gap. A reversal of those results would narrow it to one.

Corbett, typically, refused to look beyond her own match. "I couldn't tell you what Millwall are doing this weekend. I genuinely couldn't. Haverford. That's the only word in my vocabulary until Saturday at five o'clock."

Saturday, then. Bridgewater Stadium. Forty-eight thousand. Everything to play for.
