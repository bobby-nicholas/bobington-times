summary: "The Copper Review Commission convened its first hearing Monday in a Municipal Chamber packed to the rafters, hearing testimony from Chief Engineer Okonkwo, Deputy Treasurer Whitford, and Greymoor mine chairman Haversten. With copper at 889 florins per tonne and a 500-million-florin overrun mounting, the commission faces an impossible arithmetic — and the clock is already running."

The marble corridors of the Municipal Chamber have witnessed many contentious sessions in their hundred and sixty years, but few can have begun with quite the theatre of Monday morning's first hearing of the Copper Review Commission.

By half past eight — thirty minutes before the scheduled start — every seat in the public gallery was occupied. Docklands Workers' Association members, more than two hundred strong, filled the upper tiers in disciplined rows, their work jackets conspicuous among the dark suits and winter coats of the press, the Merchants' Guild delegation, and the assorted citizens who had queued since seven. Foreman Patrick Seldon sat in the front row of the gallery, arms folded, watching with the steady patience of a man accustomed to waiting for things that matter.

Council Speaker Desmond Falk opened proceedings at precisely nine o'clock with a brief statement establishing the commission's remit: to assess the Veridan Corridor Tramway Expansion in light of the copper price crisis and report by the fifth of March. He then read a written message from Mayor Blackthorne: "The commission has my full confidence. The city awaits its deliberation."

What followed was three and a half hours of testimony that laid bare the dimensions of the crisis — and the thinness of the ground beneath every available option.

## "The Numbers Have Not Waited for Us"

Chief Transit Engineer Yara Okonkwo was the first to testify. She spoke for forty-five minutes, with a sheaf of technical drawings spread before her and a composure that belied the weight of what she was presenting.

Copper opened Monday at 889 florins per tonne — up three from Friday's close. At that price, the tramway's copper component overrun stands at approximately 510 million florins, calculated against the original budget allocation of 380 million at a baseline of 740 florins per tonne. Should copper reach 950 — the upper bound of current analyst forecasts — the overrun exceeds 620 million.

"The numbers have not waited for us," Okonkwo told the commission. "Nor will they."

She presented the three scenarios she had first outlined at the emergency council session on the nineteenth. Option one: proceed as designed, absorbing the overrun through municipal bonds at an estimated debt service of 28 to 32 million florins per year for twenty years. Option two: redesign with aluminium alloy substitution for approximately thirty per cent of copper components, reducing the overrun but producing "a materially inferior system" requiring an eighteen-month delay. Option three: phase the project — build Phase One only, from the Docklands to Midtown, and defer Phase Two until prices stabilise.

But it was her final point that drew the sharpest intake of breath from the gallery. "Every week without a decision costs this project between two and three million florins in contractor retention, idle site costs, and inflationary escalation," she said. "The commission has ten days. In those ten days, the city will spend approximately four million florins doing nothing."

Councilman Aldric Voss, co-chairing from the elevated bench alongside Councilwoman Ida Pryce, leaned forward. "At what point, Chief Engineer, does it become unconscionable to proceed?"

Okonkwo met his gaze. "At the point, Councilman, when it becomes unconscionable not to."

The gallery stirred. Pryce, to her credit, let the moment settle before directing the witness to the technical specifications.

## The Treasury's Arithmetic

Deputy Treasurer Annabel Whitford followed with testimony that was, if anything, more sobering. The city's capital contingency reserve stands at 142 million florins — partially drawn down for Bramblegate Market roof repairs earlier this year. The city can issue bonds, but its credit rating from the Continental Rating Agency assumes on-budget delivery of major infrastructure projects. A 500-million-florin overrun disclosed before groundbreaking would likely trigger a downgrade review.

"Without a downgrade, the city can raise approximately 350 million through bonds at current rates," Whitford said. "With a downgrade, borrowing costs rise by an estimated forty to sixty basis points across all municipal debt."

Voss pressed: "So there is a gap."

"At current copper prices, the gap between available financing and the overrun is approximately 160 million florins," Whitford confirmed. "That gap must be closed by savings elsewhere in the municipal budget, or by copper prices declining, or by redesign."

Or by the Kaelmar Strait reopening, though Whitford — appropriately — did not speculate on geopolitical matters.

Pryce asked whether cancellation remained cheaper than proceeding. Whitford confirmed: termination penalties stand at approximately 180 million florins — less than the overrun but a staggering sum to spend on a project that would never carry a single passenger.

## The Earth Has Opinions

The morning's most unexpected testimony came from Nils Haversten, chairman of the Miners' Cooperative of Greymoor. A weathered man in his late fifties, visibly uncomfortable in the formal surroundings, Haversten spoke with the careful directness of someone accustomed to hard ground and harder decisions.

The cooperative currently produces approximately 2,000 tonnes of copper annually from small-scale operations across the Greymoor Highlands. With investment — Haversten estimated 25 to 35 million florins — production could be scaled to 3,500 tonnes within eighteen to twenty-four months. "But that is the ceiling," he said. "The geology does not permit more without deep-shaft work that would take years."

Even at full domestic capacity, Greymoor would supply less than a third of the tramway's estimated 12,000-tonne copper requirement. The strait, in other words, cannot be bypassed.

Then Haversten disclosed what the gallery had not expected. "On Sunday morning at approximately twenty minutes past five, a seismic tremor was felt across the central Highlands," he said. "No damage. No injuries. But the first such event in eleven years."

A murmur rippled through the chamber.

"I mention this," Haversten continued, "because any discussion of rapidly expanding mining operations in the Greymoor must account for geological conditions that are not entirely understood. The earth, councillors, has opinions of her own."

Voss asked whether the tremor affected any existing mine shafts. Haversten said precautionary inspections were completed Sunday afternoon with no structural concerns identified. But the cooperative's safety board had recommended a full geological survey before any expansion — a process that would itself take three to four months.

Pryce, visibly frustrated, asked whether the cooperative could begin investment-grade preparations while the survey was underway. Haversten was noncommittal. "We are miners, Councilwoman. We do not rush."

## The Gallery Watches

Throughout the morning session, the DWA contingent in the gallery remained notably disciplined. There were murmurs — at Okonkwo's cost-of-delay figures, at Whitford's funding gap, at Haversten's tremor disclosure — but no outbursts. Seldon had reportedly addressed his members before the hearing: "We are here to be seen and to listen. The speaking comes later."

That later may arrive sooner than expected. The commission's Tuesday session will hear from the Merchants' Guild, shipping insurance representatives, and — for the first time — members of the public. Seldon has confirmed the DWA intends to present oral testimony.

Observers noted the dynamics between the co-chairs. Voss, meticulous and probing, focused his questions on cost exposure and fiscal risk. Pryce, no less sharp, consistently steered testimony toward human consequences — jobs, commutes, the communities that stand to benefit or suffer. Their exchanges were civil but pointed, and it was clear to everyone present that the commission's ultimate recommendation will depend on which frame prevails.

The hearing adjourned at half past twelve. The commission reconvenes Tuesday at nine.

Outside the Municipal Chamber, the sky was grey and the wind off the river carried the faintest taste of salt. Copper, by the lunch break, had climbed to 891. The meter, as Okonkwo observed, is still running.

The commission has nine days.
