summary: "Augustin Fell gathered his cast of eleven at the Bellvue Theatre on Wednesday evening for the first full read-through of The Lamplighter's Oath. In a cold auditorium beneath a creaking fly tower that may yet doom the building, the words of Edmund Vale began to take shape. The fundraising total stands at 74,000 of the 180,000 florins needed. The Municipal Arts Council has not yet responded to the emergency heritage grant application."

The Bellvue Theatre was not warm on Wednesday evening. Augustin Fell had turned the heating on at four o'clock, but the building is 129 years old and its heating system predates the concept of thermostat, so by seven, when the cast arrived, the auditorium had achieved the temperature of a wine cellar — cool enough to see your breath if you held a candle close.

There were no candles. There was a single work lamp on a tall stand, positioned centre stage, casting a pool of amber light across eleven wooden chairs arranged in a rough circle. Above them, the fly tower — the ironwork structure whose imminent and expensive mortality hangs over this entire enterprise — creaked in the wind like a ship at anchor.

Fell stood in the wings with a script in one hand and a mug of tea in the other. He wore his heavy cardigan — the one he has worn to every rehearsal this correspondent has ever attended, the one that is more darning than original wool. He looked tired and exhilarated in roughly equal measure.

"Right," he said. "Let us begin."

## The Words of Edmund Vale

*The Lamplighter's Oath* opens in 1843, in the chambers of the Bobington Municipal Council. Edmund Vale — superintendent of lamps, political outsider, stubborn idealist — is arguing for the extension of gas lighting from Midtown into the Docklands and the riverside districts. The council is sceptical. The Docklands are poor, the infrastructure expensive, and the councillors of 1843, like those of 2026, are mindful of the ratepayer.

The role of Vale is played by Thomas Ashworth, 47, a schoolteacher by day and a Bellvue regular for fifteen years. He read Vale's opening address — a plainspoken, slightly angry argument about what a city owes to all of its citizens, not only the prosperous ones — with a quiet conviction that drew the room still.

Opposite him, Nessa Holloway, 23, a recent graduate of the Bobington Academy of Dramatic Arts, reads the role of Vale's daughter, Clara — a character Fell invented to give the story a domestic counterweight. Clara is pragmatic where her father is principled, worried where he is defiant, and rather better at arithmetic. Miss Holloway, in her first professional engagement, brought a sharpness to the role that surprised the room.

By the end of Act One — read through without interruption, as Fell prefers on a first night — Vale has been denied his funding, lost his temper, and made an oath to light the Docklands by his own hand if the council will not.

The cast sat in silence for a moment. Then Fell said, "Good. That's where the trouble starts."

## A Telegram From Caldwell

Before the read-through began, Fell read aloud a telegram that had arrived that afternoon from Caldwell. It was from Ruben Glass, the actor who launched his career at the Bellvue in *The Ferryman's Wife* in 2011 and is now a fixture of the Caldwell stage.

"Break a leg. The Bellvue made me. Now make it last. — R.G."

Glass will return on 15 March for the benefit night, where he will perform a staged reading of a scene from the play and participate in a memorabilia auction. Tickets — priced from 5 to 25 florins — are expected to sell quickly.

## The Numbers

Fundraising stands at 74,000 florins — up from 72,000 at last report, thanks to a series of private donations in the wake of this newspaper's coverage. Fell needs 180,000 by 1 May to complete the fly tower repairs that the building inspector has deemed essential. That leaves 106,000 florins to raise in nine weeks.

The benefit night on 15 March is the largest single fundraising event planned. Fell is hoping it will generate between 15,000 and 25,000 florins, but that depends on attendance, auction prices, and the generosity of a city that is currently worrying about copper, spice, and bridges.

The Municipal Arts Council has not yet responded to Fell's application for an emergency heritage grant, submitted ten days ago. Councilwoman Pryce — whose Docklands constituency includes Marchmont Street — is understood to be supportive, but the Arts Council's discretionary budget is modest, and there are competing claims.

"I am not in the business of begging," Fell said, after the cast had dispersed into the cold night. "I am in the business of theatre. If the play is good enough, the rest will follow."

Above him, the fly tower creaked. It has been creaking for 129 years. Whether it has another year in it is the question that everything now depends upon.
