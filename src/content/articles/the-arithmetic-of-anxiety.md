I went to the Municipal Chamber on Wednesday morning because I had nothing better to do, which is the reason I do most things, and because a man who writes about cities ought occasionally to witness the moments when cities discover they are in trouble.

The gallery was full by nine. I found myself wedged between a woman in a fur-collared coat who smelled of lavender and a dockworker who smelled of the docks. Both were there for the same reason: to learn whether the tram line that has been promised to this city for the better part of a decade would survive its first collision with reality.

Reality, as it turned out, arrived in the form of a spreadsheet.

Chief Engineer Okonkwo — a woman of formidable competence and, one suspects, even more formidable patience — stood before the council and projected numbers onto a screen that occupied the space where a portrait of Alderman Bancroft used to hang. The numbers were large, red, and demoralising. The councillors received them the way one receives a telegram bearing bad news: with a brief, collective intake of breath, followed by an urgent desire to blame someone.

What followed was five hours of debate that I will not recount in full, because life is short and the reader is busy. But the essence was this: copper is expensive, the strait is closed, the budget is broken, and nobody knows what to do about it, but everyone is quite certain that someone else is at fault.

Councilman Voss rose like Lazarus, vindicated. He had warned us. He had told us so. He had, four days ago, stood in this very chamber and predicted ruin. He did not say "I told you so" in those precise words, but the words he chose were close cousins, and they knew each other well.

Councilwoman Pryce fought back with the ferocity of a woman who has spent eight years pushing a boulder up a hill and will not countenance watching it roll back. "A pause is a coffin," she said, and I wrote it down because it was true, and because the best political rhetoric has the virtue of economy.

I confess that I understood perhaps a third of the technical testimony. Catenary systems, aluminium alloy substitutions, debt service projections — these are the languages of a world I have chosen not to inhabit. But I understood the faces. The Deputy Treasurer's careful, slightly frightened precision. Okonkwo's grief, barely masked, as she described the inferior tramway she might be forced to build. Guildmaster Voss's blunt exhaustion — the man runs a trade association, not a sovereign nation, and you could see in his eyes the weight of being asked to solve a geopolitical crisis with a shipping manifest.

And I understood the dockworkers in the upper gallery. Thirty of them, silent for the most part, watching. A foreman named Seldon spoke to reporters during the recess, and what he said was simple: six thousand jobs were promised, and now those jobs are wrapped in spreadsheets that change by the hour. He wanted to know what happens to the workers when the numbers turn red.

It is a reasonable question. I have not heard a satisfying answer.

My plumber, Doyle, came round on Monday to fix a leaking tap. When he presented his bill, I noticed the materials charge had increased by what I can only describe as an ambitious margin.

"Copper," Doyle said, with the philosophical resignation of a man who has learned to pass along his misfortunes. "Pipe fittings up twelve per cent in a fortnight. Don't blame me. Blame the Delvarians."

I did not blame the Delvarians, partly because they were not present and partly because I suspect the Delvarians do not think about my plumbing. But Doyle's bill, modest as it was, contained in miniature the same crisis that consumed the Municipal Chamber: a thing that happens very far away, in a strait most Bobingtonians could not find on a map, reaches into the most intimate recesses of daily life and makes everything a little worse.

This is what anxiety feels like when it is expressed in florins. Not a single dramatic catastrophe, but a steady, pervasive creep. The coffee at Rensler's costs four florins now, up from three-sixty. The tram fare holds at fifty centimes because the Transit Authority absorbs the difference, but the Transit Authority's reserves are not infinite. The pipe fittings cost more. The heating oil costs more. The spices at Bramblegate Market cost more. Each increase is small enough to absorb and large enough, in aggregate, to change the texture of a life.

The council debates hundreds of millions. The citizen adjusts in tens.

What struck me most about Wednesday's session was not the shouting — council chambers are built for shouting, and the marble amplifies it beautifully — but the silence that preceded the final vote. When Speaker Falk called the question on the Copper Review Commission, there was a pause of perhaps five seconds during which every member of that chamber, from the most senior councillor to the most junior clerk, seemed to recognise that they were making a decision about a future they could not predict.

The commission passed unanimously. Pryce and Voss will co-chair it, which is either statesmanship or comedy, depending on one's perspective. They have fourteen days to tell the city whether the tramway survives, and in what form, and at what cost.

Fourteen days. The arithmetic will not stand still while they deliberate. Copper rose another nine florins on Wednesday. The Delvarian fleet shows no sign of leaving the Strait. Sir Duncan Hale is in Thessara doing whatever diplomats do when the stakes are real and the options are few.

I walked home from the Municipal Chamber through the Docklands, past the shuttered remains of the Mercer & Holt warehouse, past the dockyards where Seldon's workers load and unload the cargoes that feed the city's appetites. The tram line, when it comes — if it comes — will run along this very route, carrying workers from the Docklands to Midtown in fourteen minutes instead of forty-five.

Yesterday these streets were draped in scarlet and gold for the Rovers' parade. Two hundred thousand people, singing. Today, the bunting is coming down, and the arithmetic is going up, and the distance between euphoria and dread is exactly twenty-four hours.

Cities survive, I think, not because they make the right decisions — they rarely do, at least not on the first attempt — but because they refuse to stop making them. The council voted. The commission will meet. Okonkwo will redesign, or phase, or borrow. Doyle will raise his prices. Rensler will serve the coffee. The trams, one way or another, will run.

The anxiety is real. But so is the city. And the city, I have found, is always larger than its arithmetic.
