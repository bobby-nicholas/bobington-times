I have attended a great many hearings in the Municipal Chamber over the years. The chamber is built to make a person feel small. The marble is deliberate. The acoustics are deliberate. The raised dais where the commissioners sit, looking down at the witness lectern like magistrates at a dock, is entirely deliberate. The architecture says: you are here to answer. We are here to judge.

Patrick Seldon did not appear to have received this message.

The foreman of the Docklands Workers' Association stood at the lectern on Tuesday morning with both hands placed flat upon it, and spoke for thirty-seven minutes, and in those thirty-seven minutes the architecture of the chamber reversed itself. The commissioners looked up. The gallery leaned forward. The marble, for once, had nothing to say.

I will not rehearse the substance of his testimony. Miss Alcott's account in these pages is thorough and authoritative, and I commend it to you. What I wish to record is something that no transcript will capture, because it was not in the words.

Seldon's hands.

I was seated in the press gallery, perhaps twenty feet from the witness lectern, at a slight elevation. From that angle, I could see his hands clearly. They were the hands of a man who has spent thirty years on a waterfront. The knuckles were thick. The fingernails were clean but permanently ridged. There was a scar across the back of the left hand, long healed, that whitened when he gripped the lectern's edge.

These hands rested on marble that was laid by men who worked, presumably, with similar hands. I do not know whether this occurred to Seldon. I suspect it did not. He is not, I think, a man given to architectural metaphors. But it occurred to me, and it occurs to me still, and I find that I cannot set it aside.

The commission has heard testimony from an engineer, a treasurer, a geologist, a guildmaster, and two insurance men. All of them spoke well. Several spoke brilliantly. But all of them spoke about the problem from the outside — as experts, as analysts, as people whose relationship to the tramway is professional. Seldon spoke from inside. The tramway is not his brief. It is his life.

There is a fashion in civic discourse — and I am as guilty of it as anyone — for abstraction. We speak of "the workforce" and "labour costs" and "human capital," as though the people who build things are a category rather than a collection of individual human beings with mortgages and children and scars on their hands. The abstraction is convenient. It allows us to move figures around a ledger without confronting the fact that each figure has a face.

Seldon named three people on Tuesday. A riveter named Ged Halloran, who stayed in Bobington when he could have gone to Ironhall. A cable-layer named Petra Voss, who borrowed 280 florins for a certification course. An apprentice welder named Samuel Obi, who is nineteen years old and has never held a full-time position.

Three names out of four thousand. But three names are enough to shatter an abstraction. Halloran is not "the workforce." He is a man with a wife and two boys in Chandler's Row who bet his family's stability on a promise from his council. Petra Voss is not "labour costs." She is a woman who went into debt to acquire a skill that her city told her it needed. Samuel Obi is not "human capital." He is a boy waiting for his life to start.

I do not know what the commission will recommend. I do not know whether the tramway will proceed, or be redesigned, or be phased, or be suspended while diplomats negotiate in distant drawing rooms over the passage of cargo ships through a strait most Bobingtonians could not find on a map. I do not know, and I confess that my opinions on the matter are of no more value than Doyle the plumber's, which is to say: strongly held and entirely uninformed.

But I know this. When the commission writes its report — and it has eight days remaining — it will be written in the language of options and recommendations and fiscal projections. It will be careful. It will be balanced. It will weigh the costs and the benefits with the scrupulous fairness that commissions are designed to produce.

And somewhere in that report, I hope, there will be a sentence that remembers Patrick Seldon's hands on the marble lectern. Not because sentiment should override arithmetic. It should not. But because arithmetic without sentiment is just accountancy, and a city is not a ledger.

A city is a place where a man stands up in a room full of marble and says: we built this. Do not forget us.

I walked home from the Municipal Chamber on Tuesday afternoon through the Docklands. It was raining lightly. The streets smelled of the river and of something frying. A woman was hanging laundry from a second-floor window on Chandler's Row. Two boys were kicking a ball against a wall on Pilot's Alley.

I thought of Ged Halloran, who lives somewhere on this street. I thought of Petra Voss, who walks these pavements with 280 florins of debt and a certificate that may or may not lead to a job. I thought of Samuel Obi, nineteen, waiting.

The commission will report by 5 March. The tramway will or will not proceed. The copper will or will not arrive. The diplomats will or will not succeed.

In the meantime, the Docklands goes on. The hands that build the city continue to do their work. They do not wait for commissions. They do not read reports. They get up in the morning and they go to the waterfront and they do what they have always done, which is to carry things that other people have decided need carrying.

The testimony was thirty-seven minutes long. The silence afterward was longer.
