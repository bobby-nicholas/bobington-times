The marble halls of Bobington's Municipal Chamber rang with applause late Thursday evening as Council Speaker Desmond Falk struck his gavel a final time, confirming a 7-4 vote in favor of the Veridan Corridor Tramway Expansion — a project that transit advocates have championed for more than thirty years.

The approved plan calls for 14 miles of new track stretching from the bustling wharves of the Docklands district, through the commercial heart of Midtown, and terminating at the leafy avenues of Upper Fernwich. Twelve new stations will be constructed along the route, with major interchange hubs planned at Caldecott Square and the Bramblegate Market.

"This is a generational investment in Bobington's future," declared Councilwoman Ida Pryce, who has led the tramway campaign since her first term eight years ago. "When the last rail is laid, this city will move as it was always meant to."

## Opposition and Concerns

Not all in the chamber shared the jubilant mood. The four dissenting votes came from council members representing the Thornhill and East Palisade districts, who expressed concern about the project's estimated cost of 3.2 billion florins and its impact on small businesses along the construction route.

Councilman Aldric Voss, the most vocal opponent, warned that the project could "drain the municipal treasury at precisely the moment our schools and fire brigades are calling out for resources." He proposed a scaled-back alternative that would have stopped the line at Caldecott Square, but the amendment failed to gain traction.

The Bobington Merchants' Guild has issued a statement acknowledging the long-term benefits of improved transit while urging the council to establish a robust compensation fund for shopkeepers displaced during the estimated four-year construction period.

## Engineering and Timeline

Chief Transit Engineer Yara Okonkwo presented the final engineering assessment to the council prior to the vote, detailing a phased construction approach that would begin with the Docklands-to-Midtown segment. That first phase is expected to break ground in early autumn, with service commencing within two years.

The full line to Upper Fernwich would follow in a second phase, with an anticipated completion date in the spring of 2030. Okonkwo noted that the project would employ an estimated 6,000 workers at peak construction and utilize locally sourced Greymoor granite for the station facades.

"We've studied tramway systems in Verlaine, Port Caravel, and the Ashford Republic," Okonkwo told the council. "We've taken the best of each and adapted it to Bobington's unique geography and needs."

## What Comes Next

Mayor Harriet Blackthorne is expected to formally sign the appropriations bill within the week. Her office released a statement calling the vote "a triumph of vision over timidity."

For commuters like Estelle Danforth, who makes the ninety-minute journey from the Docklands to her bookkeeping office in Upper Fernwich each day, the news was deeply personal. Reached by telephone after the vote, Danforth said simply: "It's about time."
