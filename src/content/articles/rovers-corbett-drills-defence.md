summary: "Phillipa Corbett devoted Wednesday's training session entirely to set-piece defence as the Rovers prepare for Saturday's trip to Duncastle, where Marcus Dunbar — the league's leading aerial threat — and a desperate home side await. Theo Harwick trained alongside Ronan Cahill at centre-back, with the injured Blackshaw offering quiet instruction from the touchline."

There were no attacking drills at the Thornhill training ground on Wednesday. No crossing practice, no shooting exercises, no through-ball combinations. For ninety minutes in thin February sunshine, Phillipa Corbett's Bobington Rovers did one thing: they defended set pieces.

Corners from both sides, delivered by Nadia Osei with military precision. Free kicks from the flanks, curled and floated and driven. Even long throws, hurled by a coaching assistant from the edge of the penalty area with the enthusiasm of a man who has been told that Duncastle's right-back can launch the ball further than most players can kick it.

"Saturday isn't about playing pretty," Corbett said afterwards, arms folded, watching the squad troop inside. "Saturday is about not losing headers."

## The Dunbar Problem

The Rovers' scouting report on Duncastle FC makes for sobering reading. The Coalfield Ground side, sixteenth in the table on 26 points and increasingly frantic, have won three of their last four home matches — all by a single goal, all decided by set pieces.

At the centre of this aerial bombardment is Marcus Dunbar, the 27-year-old centre-forward who leads the Premier Division with seven headed goals this season. Dunbar is six feet three inches tall, times his jumps immaculately, and has the unusual ability to redirect the ball downward from above the crossbar — a skill that makes conventional goalkeeping geometry largely irrelevant.

"You don't stop Dunbar by watching the ball," Corbett explained. "You stop him by not letting the ball reach him. That means winning the first contact, clearing your zones, and not giving them the set pieces in the first place."

## Harwick and the Sidelined Mentor

The session's most watched dynamic was at centre-back, where twenty-year-old Theo Harwick trained alongside veteran Ronan Cahill in what is expected to be the starting partnership for the foreseeable future.

Harwick, the academy graduate pressed into service by Orin Blackshaw's knee injury, has started two Premier Division matches — both in September, both defeats. He is athletic, willing, and still learning. The Duncastle match will test whether he has learned quickly enough.

From the touchline, Blackshaw watched the entire session in a knee brace and a heavy training coat. He did not shout. He did not wave his arms. But at intervals, when the session paused for Corbett to reposition players, Blackshaw walked over to Harwick and spoke to him quietly — gesturing toward the near post, toward the penalty spot, toward the spaces where Dunbar likes to arrive.

"The lad listens," Corbett said of Harwick. "That's half the battle. The other half is doing it when there are forty-eight thousand people screaming at you. Or in this case, eight thousand. The Coalfield Ground isn't Bridgewater, but it's hostile in a different way."

Duncastle's compact ground holds approximately 9,200, with the home terrace pressed tight against the pitch. Away supporters are allocated a corner section that holds 1,100. The Rovers' travelling allocation has sold out.

## The Table

Rovers sit fourteenth on 29 points from 25 matches, level on points with Haverford Town and one ahead of Ashwick Borough. Duncastle, three points below and with a significantly worse goal difference, cannot afford another defeat.

"Desperate teams are dangerous teams," Corbett said. "They're fighting for their lives. We need to match that intensity."

Blackshaw's absence — he is expected to miss at least three more matches, with a possible return on 21 March against Port Caravel Wanderers — means the Rovers' defensive spine lacks its most experienced organiser. Corbett confirmed that goalkeeper Sully Marsh will assume additional vocal responsibilities.

"Sully's been organising defences since before half this squad were born," Corbett said. "He knows what I need."

Harte and Osei are expected to start on the wings in a 4-4-2, with Kael Dunmore deployed centrally. The formation is defensive by Corbett's recent standards, but Saturday is not a day for ambition.

"Three points would be lovely," Corbett said, pulling her collar against the wind. "One point would be acceptable. No points is not."

Kick-off at the Coalfield Ground is 3 PM Saturday.
