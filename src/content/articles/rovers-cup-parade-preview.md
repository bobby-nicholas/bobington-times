If you were anywhere near Bridgewater Stadium on Saturday afternoon, you will have noticed that the scarves have not come down. They hang from lampposts, from balcony railings, from the iron fence along Bridgewater Road — hundreds of them, in the Rovers' burgundy and gold, left by supporters who walked home from the Merchants' Cup Final too euphoric to remember they'd need them again come Monday morning.

Those scarves will have plenty of company on Tuesday, when the Bobington Rovers embark on an open-topped carriage procession through the city to celebrate their first Merchants' Cup victory in eleven years. The route, confirmed by the club and the Municipal Events Office on Sunday morning, will begin at Bridgewater Stadium at noon, proceed through the Docklands along Harbourfront Parade, turn north through Midtown via Threadneedle Street, and conclude at Caldecott Square, where a stage and public viewing area are being erected for a civic reception.

Mayor Harriet Blackthorne confirmed that she will present the Freedom of the City — the highest civic honour — to the club at the Caldecott Square ceremony, a tradition last observed when the Rovers won the league title in 2009.

## "This Cup Belongs to the City"

Manager Phillipa Corbett, who endured calls for her dismissal as recently as November when the Rovers sat fourteenth in the league table, struck a generous tone at Sunday's press conference at the club's training ground in Thornhill.

"I've said all along that this is a squad with character, and they proved it in the most dramatic way possible," Corbett said. "But this cup doesn't belong to me or to any individual player. It belongs to every person who kept turning up at Bridgewater when things were difficult, and there were a lot of difficult days."

Asked about the future — specifically, whether hero midfielder Kael Dunmore might attract offers from wealthier clubs following his spectacular winning goal — Corbett was characteristically blunt.

"Kael is a Rover. He's under contract. Anyone who wants to discuss his future can discuss it with my backside as I walk out of the room."

Dunmore himself was briefly available to reporters, looking slightly dazed by the attention and sporting a bruise on his left cheekbone that he attributed to "Orin's elbow during the celebrations, not anything that happened on the pitch."

"I still can't quite believe it went in," Dunmore said of his 35-yard thunderbolt. "I hit it and I thought, 'That's gone over.' Then I heard the noise. I'll never forget that noise."

## Security and Logistics

The Metropolitan Constabulary estimates that as many as 150,000 people could line the parade route, making it one of the largest public gatherings in Bobington since the centennial celebrations of 2019. Inspector Helena Greaves, who is coordinating the security operation, urged spectators to arrive early and to follow instructions from marshals along the route.

"We want everyone to enjoy the day safely," Greaves said. "The parade will move at a walking pace and we expect the entire route to take approximately two hours. Viewing areas will be roped off along Harbourfront Parade and Threadneedle Street, and Caldecott Square will be first-come, first-served."

The Bobington Transit Authority has announced extended tram services on all lines and additional bus routes to Caldecott Square and Bridgewater Stadium. Fares will be reduced to a flat 50 centimes for all journeys on Tuesday in what the authority is calling a "Cup Day Special."

## League Matters

While the city celebrates, harder questions await Corbett and her squad. The Rovers sit fifteenth in the Premier Division with fourteen matches remaining — just three points above the relegation places. A cup triumph would ring hollow indeed if accompanied by a drop to the Second Division.

"We're aware of the situation," Corbett said, her expression sharpening. "We'll enjoy Tuesday, and then on Wednesday morning we're back to work. We've got Haverford Town at home on Saturday and we need the points."

The dual challenge of cup glory and league survival has been a recurring theme in Rovers history. The last time the club won the Merchants' Cup while simultaneously fighting relegation was in 1973, when they secured their survival on the final day of the season with a 1-0 victory over Port Caravel Wanderers — a match still spoken of in the Docklands pubs with the reverence normally reserved for religious texts.
