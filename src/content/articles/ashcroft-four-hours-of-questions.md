Gerald Ashcroft arrived at Metropolitan Constabulary headquarters on Foundry Row at nine o'clock on Thursday morning in a dark wool overcoat, accompanied by his solicitor Edmond Crayle and a junior associate from Crayle, Whitford & Associates. He entered through the main doors, nodded to no one in particular, and disappeared into the building's stone corridors.

He emerged at a quarter past one — four hours and fifteen minutes later — through a side entrance that leads to the staff carriage yard, where a private motor was waiting. He did not stop. He did not speak. Crayle, half a step behind, offered reporters a single sentence before climbing into the vehicle after his client.

"Mr. Ashcroft answered the investigators' questions fully and cooperatively, and we expect this matter to reach a satisfactory conclusion in due course."

The motor pulled away. The interview was over. The investigation, by all indications, is not.

## "Straightforward and Brief"

When Senior Inspector Callum Frye's request for the interview was made public on Wednesday, Crayle had described the expected session as "straightforward and brief" — language suggesting a formality, a clearing of the air, a chance for Ashcroft to put his version of events on the record and walk out with his reputation addressed, if not restored.

Four hours and fifteen minutes is not straightforward. It is not brief. And the side exit, away from the small cluster of reporters and photographers who had gathered at the front entrance since half past eight, tells its own story.

Two sources with knowledge of the investigation told The Bobington Times that Senior Inspector Frye presented Ashcroft with documents obtained from the insurance firm Fairweather & Chalk, which began cooperating with investigators earlier this week. The documents are understood to include internal correspondence between Ashcroft Property Group and Fairweather & Chalk regarding the valuation of the Mercer & Holt warehouse — the derelict 1882 building that was insured for 3.8 million florins despite the city's own assessment placing its value significantly lower.

"The documents tell a story that is difficult to reconcile with the company's public statements," one source said. "Frye walked him through them line by line."

A second source confirmed that the interview covered three principal areas: the circumstances of the warehouse's insurance valuation and the October 2025 policy renewal that increased the coverage; the dismissal of night watchman Thomas Breck in early January 2026 and the cessation of security patrols at the site; and the movements and communications of senior Ashcroft Property Group employees in the days immediately preceding the fire on 13 February.

"It was thorough," the source said. "Frye had done his homework."

Crayle's office did not respond to detailed questions submitted by The Bobington Times on Thursday afternoon.

## More Voices

The interview was not Thursday's only development. The Bobington Times has learned that two additional former Ashcroft Property Group employees have come forward independently to speak with investigators in the past forty-eight hours.

The first is understood to be a former site manager who oversaw several Ashcroft properties in the Docklands between 2023 and late 2025. The second is a former maintenance contractor who performed work on the Mercer & Holt warehouse and other Ashcroft-owned buildings during the same period. Neither has been publicly identified, and the nature of their statements is not known.

Their emergence follows the testimony of Thomas Breck, the former night watchman who told investigators on Monday that a senior Ashcroft employee ordered him to cease nightly patrols before his dismissal. Breck's solicitor, Miriam Oakes, had hinted on Wednesday that her client's experience "may not be unique" — a suggestion that appears to have been borne out.

"The picture is becoming clearer," Oakes told The Bobington Times on Thursday evening. "My client was not the only person who saw things that troubled him. He was simply the first to speak."

Oakes declined to say whether she had been in contact with the other former employees or whether they had sought independent legal representation.

## The Insurance Trail

The cooperation of Fairweather & Chalk represents a significant shift in the dynamics of the investigation. The firm, one of Bobington's established insurers with offices on Guildhall Terrace, underwrote the Ashcroft policy that valued the Mercer & Holt warehouse at 3.8 million florins — a figure that raised eyebrows when it was first reported last week, given the building's condition.

The warehouse had been vacant since the mid-2020s, when its last commercial tenant, a grain storage operation, departed. Ashcroft Property Group acquired the building in 2024 as part of a larger Docklands portfolio. The city's property assessment, conducted in 2024, placed the building's value at approximately 1.9 million florins — roughly half the insured amount.

The gap between these two figures is now understood to be a central focus of Frye's inquiry. The question is not merely whether the building was over-insured — a practice that is not in itself illegal — but whether the valuation was inflated with intent, and whether Ashcroft or his representatives supplied the figures on which Fairweather & Chalk based their policy.

Fairweather & Chalk's decision to cooperate suggests the firm believes the answer to the latter question may be yes.

"An insurance company doesn't open its books to the Constabulary because everything is in order," said one veteran of Bobington's commercial law community, who asked not to be identified. "They're protecting themselves. They want investigators to see that the numbers came from the client, not from their own underwriting."

## The Tax Dimension

Separately, the investigation is understood to have prompted renewed interest in Ashcroft Property Group's outstanding tax obligations. The firm owes the city an estimated 2.4 million florins in unpaid vacant building levies — taxes imposed on commercial properties that remain unoccupied for more than twelve months.

The levy, designed to discourage property owners from sitting on vacant buildings in high-demand areas, has been a point of contention between Ashcroft and the city assessor's office for more than two years. Ashcroft's position, according to public filings, is that several of the properties are "under active development consideration" and therefore exempt from the levy.

The Docklands safety audit authorised by the City Council on Wednesday will include a review of tax compliance for all vacant commercial properties in the district — a measure that could expose the full scope of the outstanding obligations.

## What Comes Next

Gerald Ashcroft has not been arrested or charged. The Constabulary's public affairs office issued its customary statement — "The investigation into the Greystone Wharf fire remains active, and the Metropolitan Constabulary does not comment on specific interviews or the status of any individual" — and offered nothing further.

But the trajectory of the case is unmistakable. In the six days since Fire Marshal Edwin Hale confirmed the presence of accelerant at the scene, the investigation has moved from arson confirmation to office searches, witness testimony, document seizures, insurance cooperation, and a four-hour interview with the property's owner. Two more former employees have joined the growing list of individuals willing to speak.

No charges have been filed. But the Constabulary's pace suggests that Senior Inspector Frye is building something, and building it with care.

Thomas Breck, the night watchman whose testimony set much of this in motion, was not at the Constabulary on Thursday. According to Oakes, he spent the day at home in the Docklands, where he has lived for thirty years.

"He's a private man who did a public thing," Oakes said. "He's relieved that others are finding their courage."

The ruins of the Mercer & Holt warehouse remain behind Constabulary barriers at Greystone Wharf. On Thursday afternoon, a light rain fell on the charred timbers. Two uniformed officers stood at the perimeter, and a Constabulary evidence van was parked at the western gate.

The investigation continues.
