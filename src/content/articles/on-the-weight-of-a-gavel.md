I have been to the Municipal Chamber twice in the space of five days, which is twice more than I have been in the previous five years, and I confess the experience has begun to alter my understanding of the building. It is not merely a room where arguments happen. It is a machine for making arguments feel consequential.

The marble amplifies. I have noted this before. But on Monday morning, what the marble amplified was not shouting but silence — the particular, held-breath quality of two hundred dockworkers in the gallery, sitting very still, watching three people at a long table explain to their city why everything is about to become either very expensive or very delayed or both.

Speaker Falk's gavel, I noticed, is mahogany. Heavy. Older than anyone in the room. He brought it down once, at the start of proceedings, and the sound it made was not loud but deep — the kind of sound that travels through the floor and up through the soles of your shoes. Every person in that chamber felt the start of the hearing not in their ears but in their feet.

This seems right. Decisions of this magnitude should be felt bodily.

Okonkwo spoke first, and I have come to admire this woman. She presents facts the way a surgeon presents a diagnosis — with clarity, with gravity, and with the unstated implication that the patient's survival depends on what happens next. She did not raise her voice. She did not gesture. She stood at the witness table and said, in effect: every week you deliberate, four million florins vanish. This is not an accusation. It is arithmetic.

Councilman Voss — bright-eyed, meticulous, a man who reads footnotes for pleasure — asked his question about unconscionability. It was, I thought, an honest question. When does the cost of a thing exceed the value of having it? This is not an unreasonable inquiry. It is, in fact, the most important question a city can ask about any of its ambitions.

Okonkwo's answer — "When it becomes unconscionable not to" — was delivered without hesitation and without rhetoric. She simply meant it. The gallery understood. Pryce, on the bench, did not smile, but there was a shift in her posture — a fractional straightening — that communicated something close to satisfaction.

I do not know whether the tramway should proceed at 510 million florins over budget. I do not know whether aluminium is a suitable substitute for copper in catenary systems, or what a debt service ratio is, or whether Greymoor granite can be sourced in parallel with Greymoor copper. These are questions for minds more numerate than mine.

But I know what it looks like when a person believes in their work, and Okonkwo believes in this tramway the way Doyle believes in pipe fittings — completely, practically, without romance, and with the conviction that the thing must be done right or not at all.

Whitford was harder to watch. The Deputy Treasurer is not a woman built for spectacle. She is built for spreadsheets, for footnotes, for the careful, grey, essential work of counting a city's money and explaining why there is not enough of it. She spoke quietly. She consulted her notes. She said that the gap between available financing and the overrun was approximately 160 million florins, and she said it the way a doctor says a number you didn't want to hear — accurately, and without comfort.

The gallery received this with a murmur that Falk silenced with a look. He did not need the gavel. His eyebrows were sufficient.

Then came Haversten, and the room changed.

I had not expected to be moved by the chairman of a mining cooperative. He is a practical man — weathered hands, a voice like gravel in a tin can, the visible discomfort of someone who would rather be underground than under examination. He spoke of tonnes and shafts and investment timelines, and I confess I understood very little of the technical detail.

But I understood the moment when he said: "The earth has opinions of her own."

He was referring to a tremor felt across the Greymoor Highlands on Sunday morning — a minor event, no damage, no injuries, but the first such in eleven years. The miners felt it. Their families felt it. And Haversten, standing in the Municipal Chamber in his one good jacket, felt it necessary to say so, because expanding the mines means sending more men deeper into rock that has recently reminded everyone it is not entirely stable.

The gallery went very quiet.

There are moments in public life when the abstractions fall away — the cost projections, the bond rates, the diplomatic signals — and what remains is irreducibly human. A man whose livelihood depends on the ground beneath his feet, telling a commission that the ground moved. That is not testimony. That is a kind of prayer.

I left the Municipal Chamber at half past twelve, when the hearing adjourned. The corridor was full of people who had been sitting for three and a half hours, stretching, talking in low voices, checking pocket watches. Seldon, the dockworkers' foreman, stood near the entrance speaking to a younger man I did not recognise. His face was unreadable.

Outside, the February wind had a malicious quality — the kind that finds the gap between collar and neck and exploits it. I walked to Rensler's, which is what I do when reality requires processing, and ordered coffee, which is what I drink when thinking is required.

Rensler charged me four florins. I did not complain. The man has his own arithmetic.

The commission has nine days. In nine days, Pryce and Voss must agree — or fail to agree — on a recommendation that will shape this city for a generation. They must weigh the cost of proceeding against the cost of not proceeding, the risk of borrowing against the risk of cancelling, the price of copper against the price of doing nothing while copper gets more expensive.

And they must do it in public, in a marble room, under the gaze of two hundred men in work jackets who want to know whether the jobs they were promised will exist next year.

The gavel is mahogany. It is heavier than it looks. I suspect it will feel heavier still when Falk brings it down for the final time.
