The Metropolitan Constabulary has taken the most significant step yet in the Greystone Wharf investigation, formally requesting that property magnate Gerald Ashcroft present himself for interview at headquarters on Thursday morning.

The request, confirmed by two sources with direct knowledge of the case, was communicated on Wednesday afternoon to Ashcroft's solicitor, Edmond Crayle of Crayle, Whitford & Associates. It asks Ashcroft to attend voluntarily to answer questions about the circumstances surrounding the fire at the Mercer & Holt warehouse on 13 February — the insurance arrangements on the property, and the dismissal of night watchman Thomas Breck six weeks before the blaze.

Ashcroft has not been arrested or charged. The request falls short of a formal summons, which would carry legal compulsion. But the escalation from background investigation to a direct interview with the firm's principal is a clear signal that Senior Inspector Callum Frye's inquiry has reached a decisive phase.

## Crayle's Response

Crayle issued a statement within the hour, confirming that Ashcroft would attend.

"Mr. Ashcroft has cooperated fully with the Constabulary at every stage and will continue to do so," Crayle said. "He welcomes the opportunity to address the investigators directly and is confident that his answers will dispel the cloud of speculation that has gathered around his company. He has nothing to hide and never has."

Crayle added that Ashcroft would be accompanied by counsel and expected the interview to be "straightforward and brief."

Whether Senior Inspector Frye shares that expectation is unclear. The Constabulary's public affairs office declined to comment beyond confirming that "the investigation into the Greystone Wharf fire remains active and inquiries are ongoing."

## Fairweather & Chalk Open Their Books

In a development that may prove equally consequential, The Bobington Times has learned that Fairweather & Chalk, the insurance firm that underwrote the Ashcroft policy on the Greystone Wharf property, has begun voluntarily providing its internal records to investigators.

The firm, which has faced scrutiny over a policy that valued the derelict 1882 warehouse at 3.8 million florins — significantly above the city's own assessment — appears to be distancing itself from its client. A person familiar with the firm's position said Fairweather & Chalk had "concluded that full transparency is in the firm's best interest" and was providing documents including the original valuation survey, correspondence with Ashcroft representatives, and the renewal documentation from October 2025.

"They're cooperating because they've done their own internal review and they don't like what they've found," a source close to the investigation said. "The question is whether the inflated valuation originated with Fairweather & Chalk or whether it was supplied to them by Ashcroft."

Crayle's office did not respond to a request for comment on the insurance firm's cooperation.

## "Not the Only One"

The testimony of former night watchman Thomas Breck, who told investigators on Monday that a senior Ashcroft employee ordered him to cease nightly patrols before his dismissal, remains central to the case. But his solicitor, Miriam Oakes, hinted on Wednesday that the investigation's evidentiary base may be widening.

"Mr. Breck has told the truth about what happened to him," Oakes told The Bobington Times. "But I would observe that a company with fourteen vacant properties in the Docklands employed more than one security guard. Mr. Breck's experience may not be unique."

The remark suggests that other former Ashcroft employees may be coming forward — or may be sought by investigators. The Constabulary declined to confirm or deny whether additional witnesses had been interviewed.

## Council Authorises Audit

Wednesday's emergency council session, convened to address the copper crisis, also produced a significant development for the Greystone investigation. Councilwoman Ida Pryce's motion for a comprehensive safety audit of all vacant commercial properties in the Docklands was passed 8-3.

The audit, which the council's regulatory affairs division will conduct over the coming weeks, will examine fire safety compliance, insurance arrangements, and security provisions at dozens of properties — including the fourteen other Docklands sites owned by Ashcroft Property Group.

"This is not a witch hunt," Pryce said after the vote. "It is a basic exercise in public safety that should have been conducted years ago. One warehouse has already burned. The council has a responsibility to ensure no more follow."

Councilman Aldric Voss voted against the motion, arguing it fell outside the emergency session's agenda. "We were called here to discuss copper and the tramway," Voss said. "Turning an emergency session into a vehicle for other business, however worthy, sets a precedent I am not comfortable with."

## Timeline

The Greystone Wharf investigation has moved with striking speed since the Fire Marshal's confirmation of arson on 15 February:

- **13 Feb:** Three-alarm fire destroys the Mercer & Holt warehouse. Four firefighters treated for smoke inhalation.
- **15 Feb:** Fire Marshal Edwin Hale confirms accelerant found at the scene. Arson declared.
- **17 Feb:** Constabulary executes search warrant at Ashcroft Property Group offices on Harker Street. Former night watchman Thomas Breck provides detailed testimony.
- **18 Feb:** Breck names a senior Ashcroft employee who ordered him to cease patrols. Seized documents reveal insurance irregularities.
- **19 Feb:** Senior Inspector Frye requests Ashcroft's attendance for formal interview. Fairweather & Chalk begin cooperating. Council authorises Docklands safety audit.

Gerald Ashcroft has not spoken publicly since the fire. Thursday's interview, whatever its outcome, will be the first time he has faced the Constabulary's questions directly.

The Mercer & Holt warehouse, built in 1882, was one of the oldest structures on the Bobington waterfront. Its ruins, fenced off behind Constabulary barriers and smelling still of char and accelerant, are visible from every ship entering Port Sovereign.
