summary: "The Eastern Spice Index climbed to 356 on Wednesday as the Merchants' Guild finalised preparations for Thursday's emergency session — the first since 2011. Two smaller spice merchants have closed temporarily, and the Guild's petition urging the Foreign Office to include the spice trade in Kaelmar diplomatic discussions has gathered 52 signatures. The naming of a Delvarian envoy has given merchants cautious hope that relief may be approaching."

On Ashbury Lane, where the scent of cardamon and dried bark has drifted from warehouse doorways for three generations, two shops were shuttered on Wednesday. Their proprietors had run out of stock, run out of patience, or both.

Hamid Rassam, whose father Youssef established the family's dried bark and root spice business in 1968, hung a hand-lettered sign in his window shortly after noon: "Closed Until Supply Resumes. We Apologise." He had sold his last case of black cardamon on Tuesday evening. His velveroot stock was exhausted a week ago. He retains small quantities of domestically sourced herbs, but not enough to justify remaining open.

"I am not a herb shop," Rassam told this newspaper. "I am a spice merchant. Without spice, I am a man standing in an empty room."

Four doors along, Elia Thorne — whose herb and spice shop on Chandler's Row has served the Docklands for nineteen years — had already drawn her blinds on Monday, though this newspaper only learned of it on Wednesday. Thorne said she could not in good conscience sell her remaining eastern stock at the prices the market now demanded.

"My customers are dockworkers and their families," she said. "They are not speculators. I will not charge a riveter's wife four florins for a thumb of peppervine."

## The Index Climbs

The Eastern Spice Index, the twelve-spice weighted basket tracked by the Bramblegate Exchange, closed Wednesday at 356 — another record, up from 351 on Tuesday and now 27 per cent above its level of a fortnight ago. The previous all-time high of 327, set during the dockers' strike of 2011, has been surpassed for seven consecutive trading days.

Haroun Nazari, the senior merchant on Ashbury Lane and de facto spokesman for the trade, is now limiting purchases on 18 of his 32 varieties — up from 14 on Tuesday. Restaurant clients receive priority. Walk-in customers are restricted to domestic herbs and whatever eastern stock can be spared.

"I am rationing," Nazari said bluntly. "I have never used that word about spice before."

## The Guild Prepares

The Merchants' Guild will convene its emergency session at Guild Hall on Thursday at 10 AM — the first such session since the dockers' strike, and only the fourth in the Guild's 270-year history.

The agenda, circulated to members on Wednesday, includes three items: coordinated stockpile management to prevent hoarding and price manipulation; an emergency pricing framework to cap retail margins on essential spices; and the formal presentation to the Foreign Office of the Guild's petition urging that spice trade be included in any diplomatic resolution of the Kaelmar Strait crisis.

The petition now carries 52 signatures, up from 47 on Tuesday, representing firms that collectively account for an estimated 60 per cent of the eastern spice trade passing through Bobington's markets.

Guildmaster Hadrian Voss, who presented the Guild's twelve-page submission to the Copper Review Commission on Tuesday, has been shuttling between the commission, the Guild offices, and the Bramblegate Exchange for the better part of a week. Asked whether the naming of a Delvarian envoy on Wednesday offered grounds for optimism, he was characteristically measured.

"An envoy is not a treaty," he said. "But an envoy is not nothing."

## Diplomacy and Dried Bark

The timing of Count Soren's designation as Delvarian envoy is, from the spice merchants' perspective, the first piece of genuinely encouraging news since the crisis began. If a quiet channel meeting occurs within days — as diplomatic sources suggest — there is at least a theoretical possibility that commercial shipping access through the Kaelmar Strait could be among the topics discussed.

Whether spice merchants' concerns will register alongside copper prices, naval positioning, and treaty interpretation is another question. The Guild's petition makes the case that the eastern spice trade employs approximately 800 people in Bobington directly and supports a further 2,200 in hospitality, food preparation, and retail — numbers that, while modest beside the tramway's 6,000, represent livelihoods that are disappearing in real time.

"Copper is discussed in the Municipal Chamber," Rassam observed. "Spice is discussed in the kitchen. But the kitchen feeds the city."

Thursday's emergency session is open to Guild members only, but Guildmaster Voss has indicated he will make a public statement afterwards. The Foreign Office has acknowledged receipt of the petition but has not commented on whether the spice trade features in its diplomatic brief.

The Eastern Spice Index opens Thursday at 356. Rassam's shop remains closed. The sign in his window was, he noted, written in velveroot ink — the last of his supply, put to its final purpose.
