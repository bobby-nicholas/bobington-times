summary: "The Bramblegate Exchange's Eastern Spice Index rose to a record high on Monday as prolonged disruption to Kaelmar Strait shipping drove wholesale prices for key imports to levels not seen since the index's creation in 2003. The Merchants' Guild announced an emergency session for Thursday to discuss stockpile management and emergency pricing. At least seven prominent restaurants have now pulled signature dishes from their menus."

The numbers on the board at the Bramblegate Exchange on Monday morning told a story that required no interpretation. The Eastern Spice Index — a weighted basket of the twelve most-traded imported spices — opened at 341, surpassing its previous record of 327 set during the Thessarine dock workers' strike of 2018 and climbing steadily through the morning session to close at 348.

In the space of ten days, the index has risen 22 per cent. In the space of ten days, the daily commerce of cooking, eating, and feeding a city of several million has been quietly, decisively disrupted.

## The Cascade

The arithmetic is straightforward. Approximately half of Bobington's eastern spice supply transits the Kaelmar Strait under normal conditions. With commercial insurance effectively unavailable for the route and twelve vessels now rerouting via the Cape of Sarenne — adding twelve to fifteen days to each voyage — the supply chain has not collapsed but contracted, like a river forced through a narrower channel.

The first casualties were the rare and seasonal. Velveroot, the fragrant Thessarine bark used in braised dishes and winter pastries, has been exhausted from wholesale markets for a week. Black cardamon, still available but at prices 18 per cent above the pre-crisis level, is being rationed by merchants who fear worse to come. Dried saffron bark, golden peppervine, and smoked coriander seed have all risen between 10 and 20 per cent.

The second wave is now reaching consumers. Haroun Nazari, the third-generation spice merchant on Ashbury Lane whose family has traded since 1962, reported Monday that he has begun limiting sales of seven varieties to existing restaurant clients only. Walk-in retail customers are being turned away for anything beyond common stock.

"My grandfather would not have believed it," Nazari said, standing amid the half-empty shelves of his warehouse. "Sixty years in this trade and I have never refused to sell to a customer who has money in his hand."

## Seven Restaurants and Counting

Simeon Kade of The Willow Table was the first restaurateur to publicly remove a dish — his signature braised lamb shoulder, which requires velveroot — from his menu. He is no longer alone.

The Bobington Times has confirmed that at least seven prominent restaurants across Midtown and the Merchants' Quarter have made similar adjustments in the past week. Among them: The Ashen Grill on Threadneedle Street has replaced its eastern-spiced duck with a Greymoor herb preparation. Harrowgate House, the Docklands institution known for its peppered crab, has switched to a domestic seasoning blend. Bellamy's of Caldecott Square has eliminated its spiced dessert course entirely.

The changes range from the pragmatic to the philosophical. Kade described his approach as "honest adaptation" — using what is available rather than using inferior substitutes. Others have been less sanguine.

"We are a city that prides itself on its table," said Marguerite Fontenoy, executive chef at Verlaine's, the Midtown restaurant whose eastern-influenced cuisine has earned it a devoted following. "To strip our menus of the flavours that define them is not adaptation. It is surrender."

Fontenoy has not yet removed any dishes but acknowledged that her spice reserves will last "perhaps three weeks at current usage." After that, she said, the menu will change whether she wishes it or not.

## Guild Response

The Merchants' Guild announced Monday that Guildmaster Hadrian Voss — no relation to the councilman — will convene an emergency session on Thursday to discuss the spice trade crisis. The session will address three issues: the feasibility of coordinated stockpile management among guild members to prevent hoarding, emergency pricing guidelines to limit profiteering, and a formal petition to the Bobington Foreign Office requesting that spice trade access be included in any diplomatic negotiations regarding the Kaelmar Strait.

"This is no longer a shipping inconvenience," Voss said in a brief statement. "This is a commercial emergency affecting hundreds of businesses and thousands of livelihoods. The guild will act accordingly."

The petition to the Foreign Office represents a notable escalation. Until now, the guild has treated the Kaelmar disruption as a commercial matter to be managed through rerouting and cost absorption. The decision to seek diplomatic intervention suggests that the guild's tolerance — and its members' financial reserves — are approaching their limits.

## The Broader Picture

The spice trade, for all its culinary prominence, represents a relatively small fraction of Bobington's total import volume. The larger economic story remains copper, which closed Monday at 889 florins per tonne after a volatile session influenced by both the Delvarian diplomatic statement and the Copper Review Commission testimony.

But spice is visible in a way that copper is not. Copper affects municipal budgets, interest rates, infrastructure timelines — abstractions that matter enormously but are felt indirectly. Spice affects dinner. The disappearance of a favourite dish, the unfamiliar taste of a substitute, the apologetic note on a restaurant menu — these are the encounters through which a geopolitical crisis becomes personal.

The Bramblegate Exchange will open Tuesday morning. The Eastern Spice Index will, in all likelihood, continue to climb. The Kaelmar Strait will remain, for practical purposes, closed. And the kitchens of Bobington will continue to improvise, adapt, and, in some cases, mourn.

The emergency guild session convenes Thursday at ten o'clock at Guild Hall. It will be the first emergency session called by the guild since the great dockers' strike of 2011.
