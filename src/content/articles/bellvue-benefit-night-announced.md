Augustin Fell stood on the stage of the Bellvue Theatre on Tuesday morning and did what he has done for nineteen years: he introduced a cast to an empty auditorium, promised them something extraordinary, and asked them to trust him.

The cast of eleven, assembled for the first rehearsal of *The Lamplighter's Oath*, sat in a semicircle of mismatched chairs on a stage that Fell acknowledged, with characteristic directness, "may not exist by summer." The fly tower above their heads — the mechanical heart of the theatre, responsible for raising and lowering scenery — is the structure that requires 180,000 florins in repairs by 1 May. Without those repairs, the building inspector will not certify the theatre for public performance. Without certification, the Bellvue closes.

"So," Fell told his cast, "we had better be good."

## The Play

*The Lamplighter's Oath* is Fell's first original work as a playwright. A former history teacher at Thornhill Secondary School who inherited the Bellvue from his aunt Constance in 2007, Fell has staged over a hundred productions — Shakespeare, Verlainese comedy, Bobington premieres — but has never written one himself.

The play tells the story of Edmund Vale, Bobington's first superintendent of lamps, who in the 1840s fought to extend gas lighting from the prosperous streets of Midtown into the working-class districts that the city's council considered unworthy of illumination. It is, transparently, a play about who gets to be seen.

"I wrote it because the Bellvue is in the same fight Vale was in," Fell said. "We are in a part of the city that people walk past. We serve an audience that has no gallery donor. We survive because this building matters to this neighbourhood, and if it closes, nothing will replace it."

The cast includes several actors from the Marchmont Street repertory scene, none of them household names. Fell cast locally by design. "This is a Bobington story," he said. "It should sound like Bobington."

## The Benefit Night

The benefit evening of 15 March — six weeks into rehearsals, three and a half weeks before opening night — will be the Bellvue's most ambitious fundraising event. Fell announced the programme on Tuesday:

The evening will open with a staged reading of the first act of *The Lamplighter's Oath*, performed by the full cast in rehearsal dress. This will be followed by a live auction of historical theatre memorabilia, including original programmes dating to the Bellvue's opening season in 1897, a set of hand-painted backdrop panels from a 1923 production of *The Tempest of Sarenne*, and a first-edition script of *The Ferryman's Wife* — the 2011 production that launched the career of Ruben Glass.

Glass himself will return to the Bellvue stage for the first time since 2013 to read a scene from the play. Now a fixture of the Caldwell stage, Glass released a statement on Tuesday calling the Bellvue "the place that taught me everything."

"Augustin Fell gave me my first part when I was twenty-two and couldn't afford the tram fare to auditions," Glass said. "If the Bellvue closes, a piece of this city's culture closes with it."

Tickets for the benefit night will be priced at 5 to 25 florins — Fell was emphatic that the evening not price out the theatre's regular audience. "If you can afford twenty-five florins, wonderful. If you can afford five, you are equally welcome. The Bellvue has never been a place for people who need to be seen spending money."

## The Numbers

Donations to date stand at 72,000 florins, raised through a combination of private contributions, two small grants, and a collection jar that has sat on the box office counter since January. The figure represents 40 per cent of the target, with nine weeks remaining before the 1 May deadline.

Fell is sanguine about the gap, or at least performs sanguinity convincingly. "Seventy-two thousand florins from a community that does not have seventy-two thousand florins to spare," he said. "That tells me the will is there. The arithmetic will follow."

The Bobington Historical Preservation Society, which listed the Bellvue as one of fifty-two "structures of cultural significance" in its 2024 survey, has offered support in principle but has no discretionary funds for building repairs. The listing carries no legal protection.

Councilwoman Pryce, whose Docklands district includes Marchmont Street, has written to the Municipal Arts Council requesting an emergency heritage grant. The council has not yet responded.

## What Is at Stake

The Bellvue is Bobington's oldest continuously operating independent theatre — a distinction it has held since the closure of the Adelphi on Parade Street in 2003. It seats 380, down from an original 440, in a gilt-and-crimson Victorian auditorium that smells faintly of dust and ambition.

Over nineteen years, Fell has staged comedies, tragedies, and pantomimes. He has given first roles to actors who went on to the Caldwell stage and last roles to actors who never left Marchmont Street. He has done this on annual budgets that would not cover a single week's lighting at the Royal Bobington Gallery.

"I'd rather go out with a play than a whimper," Fell said at his press announcement in January. On Tuesday, with a cast seated before him and a deadline above him, he appeared to mean it.

Rehearsals begin in earnest on Wednesday. The benefit night is 15 March. The deadline is 1 May. The Bellvue, for now, is open.
