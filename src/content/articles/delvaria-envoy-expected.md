The contours of a diplomatic process that did not officially exist ten days ago are now becoming visible.

Diplomatic sources in Bobington and abroad told the *Times* on Tuesday that the Delvarian Empire is expected to formally designate a senior diplomat as its representative in the quiet channel framework within the coming days — possibly as early as Thursday. If confirmed, the appointment would mark the most significant step toward structured dialogue since the Kaelmar crisis began on 15 February.

## Lindqvist as Facilitator

Consul Pehr Lindqvist's unannounced visit to the Bobington Foreign Office on Monday morning — confirmed by the Foreign Office as "a scheduled meeting" — is now understood to have been a coordination session focused on the mechanics of envoy designation.

Sources familiar with the meeting said Lindqvist and Undersecretary Helena Marchetti discussed the practical requirements of the quiet channel: where meetings would be held, what level of confidentiality would apply, and what format initial consultations would take. The question of who Delvaria would appoint was discussed in general terms, though no name was communicated.

"Lindqvist is not the envoy," one diplomatic source said. "He is the man arranging the room."

This is consistent with the conditions Lindqvist relayed during his 90-minute meeting with Marchetti on 21 February: Delvaria insisted on designating its own envoy, distinct from the consul, and on maintaining strict bilateral confidentiality.

## Hale: "Tangible Progress"

Sir Duncan Hale, Bobington's envoy in Thessara, used the word "tangible" in a briefing to the Foreign Office on Tuesday morning — a careful escalation from Monday's "constructive." Sources say Hale has held two further meetings with his Thessarine interlocutor since Monday's Delvarian statement, refining the procedural framework.

The Thessarine Foreign Secretary's office confirmed that Daine's senior aide remains assigned to Hale as primary point of contact, and described the ongoing conversations as "productive and consistent with the Treaty of Ashen Bluffs."

The measured language on both sides is itself significant. As recently as last week, Thessarine statements routinely included phrases like "reckless provocation" and "flagrant disregard for treaty obligations." The shift to diplomatic formulations suggests that both parties are now operating under a shared understanding that public rhetoric must not undermine private progress.

## The Kharstad Question

The *Kharstad Gazette*, the Delvarian Empire's principal newspaper, ran no editorial comment on Tuesday — the second consecutive day of restraint following Monday's page-two placement of the Ministry statement. Diplomatic observers read the silence as deliberate. Professor Elias Thornbury of the Bobington Institute for Foreign Affairs described the pattern as "conspicuous discipline."

"The *Gazette* is an instrument of state," Thornbury said. "When it is quiet, it is because someone has told it to be quiet. That is, in its way, more eloquent than anything it could print."

The outstanding question remains the identity of the Delvarian envoy. Diplomatic convention would suggest a figure of undersecretary rank or above — senior enough to negotiate with authority, but not so senior that failure would constitute a political crisis. Several names have been mentioned in diplomatic circles, though none confirmed.

## Copper and Commerce

The copper market responded cautiously to the diplomatic signals. After opening Monday at 883 florins per tonne on the back of the Delvarian statement, prices rose through the day to 891 as commission testimony reasserted demand fundamentals. On Tuesday, copper eased slightly to 885 on modest diplomatic optimism, though traders emphasised that the Kaelmar Strait remains effectively closed to normal commercial traffic.

Twelve Bobington-registered vessels continue to route via the Cape of Sarenne. The Merchants' Guild reported that two additional cargo vessels had been diverted on Tuesday, bringing the total fleet diversion cost to approximately 1.8 million florins.

"The market wants to believe," said Clement Varga of Fernwich Trading House. "But belief and a shipping lane are different things. Until a ship passes through the strait unmolested, the premium stays."

## What Comes Next

The designation of a Delvarian envoy, should it materialise, would transform the quiet channel from an informal understanding into an operational diplomatic mechanism. It would not, however, guarantee progress. The core dispute — Delvaria's assertion of sovereign rights over the northern channel versus Thessara's insistence on treaty compliance — remains unresolved.

Nor has either side addressed the *Stormbreak* incident of 19 February, in which a Thessarine corvette detained a Delvarian fishing trawler for six hours. The crew of nine remain a potent domestic symbol in Delvaria, and any envoy would face pressure to raise the matter early.

For Bobington, whose economy depends on the strait's passage, the stakes are clear. Every day of diversion adds cost. Every day of uncertainty erodes confidence. And every day without a formal channel risks the kind of miscalculation — a second interception, a live-fire exercise gone wrong — that could render all the careful language meaningless.

Sir Duncan Hale, it is said, has not left Thessara since he arrived on 18 February. He has not needed to. The work, for now, is there.
