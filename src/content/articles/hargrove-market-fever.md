summary: "The Isolde Hargrove retrospective at the Royal Bobington Gallery has ignited a frenzy in the art market, with private collectors and auction house representatives arriving in Bobington in growing numbers. A minor Hargrove landscape reportedly changed hands for 45,000 florins last week — triple the estimate — while the Gallery reports record advance bookings through March."

One does not typically associate Isolde Hargrove with the word "frenzy." The painter from Millhaven, who has spent the better part of two decades avoiding galleries, journalists, and anything that might be described as a public life, would sooner paint another hundred portraits of Greymoor farm walls than attend to the business of being collected.

The business, however, has come to her.

In the ten days since "Light Through Glass" opened at the Royal Bobington Gallery, something remarkable has happened beyond the queues and the critical adulation. The art market — that peculiar ecosystem of dealers, auction houses, private collectors, and assorted speculators — has woken up to a simple fact: there are not very many Hargrove paintings in circulation, and a great many people who suddenly want one.

## The Numbers

Gallery director Simone Aldair confirmed on Tuesday that advance bookings for the exhibition have already exceeded twenty-two thousand through the end of March — a figure that, if realised, would make "Light Through Glass" the most attended exhibition in the Gallery's history, surpassing the Matthias Crane memorial show of 2009.

"We are adding evening openings on Fridays and Saturdays beginning next week," Aldair said. "The response has been extraordinary. We anticipated strong interest, but not at this scale."

The exhibition itself — 120 works spanning five decades, from the luminous graduation piece "Morning, Ashford Bay" (1974) to a series of previously unexhibited late portraits — has drawn near-universal critical acclaim. But it is the secondary market that is generating the most intense activity.

Sources in the Bobington art trade report that at least three private sales of Hargrove works have been completed since the exhibition opened, at prices that have startled even seasoned dealers. The most notable, a modest landscape titled "November Light, Greymoor" (2011), reportedly changed hands between two private collectors for 45,000 florins — roughly triple the price the painting fetched at its last recorded sale in 2017.

"The Hargrove market was always thin — she never produced in volume, and she never actively sold," said Desmond Grayle, director of Grayle & Finch Fine Art on Bramblegate Lane, one of the city's oldest dealerships. "What the retrospective has done is remind people how extraordinarily good she is. And when demand meets scarcity, the arithmetic is simple."

## Auction Houses Circle

Representatives from at least two major auction houses — Aldwyck & Horne of Port Caravel and the Verlaine-based Maison Lefèvre — have been observed in Bobington this week, reportedly meeting with known Hargrove collectors and dealers. Neither firm would confirm its intentions, but art market observers expect at least one significant Hargrove consignment to be announced for spring sales.

"The auction houses smell blood," said one dealer, speaking anonymously. "A properly curated Hargrove sale, timed to coincide with the final weeks of the exhibition, could set records. We're talking about an artist who may be the finest painter of landscape and light working today, and whose market has been essentially dormant for years."

Not all in the art world welcome the development. Tobias Renn, the elderly Millhaven farmer who sat for Hargrove's celebrated 2018 portrait, expressed bewilderment when reached by telephone.

"She painted me because I was her neighbour and she thought I had a good face," Renn said. "Now someone's telling me the painting's worth — well, I'd rather not say the number. She'd be horrified. She didn't paint it for money."

## The Artist's Silence

And what of Hargrove herself? The painter, who made a rare public appearance at the exhibition's opening on 14 February and has not been seen since, has offered no comment on the market surge. Aldair, who is understood to be the only person at the Gallery in regular contact with the artist, chose her words carefully.

"Isolde is aware of the attention," Aldair said. "I think it's fair to say she is gratified by the public response to the exhibition — to see people engaging with the work on its own terms. As for the market activity, she is... thoroughly uninterested."

Hargrove, who studied at the Bobington Academy of Fine Arts under the legendary Matthias Crane and has lived on a farmstead outside Millhaven since approximately 2006, has never employed a dealer or agent. The works in the retrospective were assembled through direct negotiation with the artist, private lenders, and institutional collections over a period of three years, according to Aldair.

"Light Through Glass" continues at the Royal Bobington Gallery through 30 June. Admission remains 8 florins, with concessions at 4 florins and free entry on Wednesdays.

*Those considering their first visit would do well to arrive early, especially on weekends. The queues on Meridian Hall's steps have become, in their own way, a Bobington spectacle.*
