Soren is a career moderate with military family credentials. Sir Duncan Hale welcomed the appointment, and copper fell to 878 florins per tonne on cautious optimism. A first meeting between the envoys is expected within days."

The Delvarian Empire named its envoy on Wednesday.

A communiqué from the Ministry of External Affairs in Kharstad, issued at 2:15 PM Bobington time, announced that Count Viktor Soren had been designated as the Empire's representative for "bilateral discussions regarding maritime security in the Kaelmar region." The statement ran to 52 words — five more than Monday's, and no less carefully composed.

The designation of Soren is, by the cautious standards of this crisis, a significant event. It is the first time Delvaria has named an individual to the diplomatic process, and it transforms the quiet channel from an informal understanding into something approaching a framework.

## The Man From Kharstad

Count Viktor Soren is 61 years old, a career diplomat who served as Delvarian ambassador to the Ashford Republic from 2011 to 2018 — a posting that gave him extensive experience in multilateral trade negotiations and, more importantly, a network of contacts across neutral capitals.

His family is military. His father, Admiral Pehr Soren, commanded the Delvarian Eastern Fleet in the 1980s and was instrumental in negotiating the naval provisions of the Treaty of Ashen Bluffs in 1987. The son grew up in Kharstad's naval quarter and chose diplomacy over a commission, a fact that reportedly caused a two-year silence between father and son.

He is described by those who have worked with him as a moderate, a pragmatist, and a man whose quietness should not be mistaken for softness. "Soren listens first," said Professor Elias Thornbury of the Bobington Institute for Foreign Affairs. "That is unusual in a Delvarian diplomat, and it is exactly what this moment requires."

His selection sends several signals simultaneously. To the military establishment in Kharstad, the Soren name provides reassurance — this is not a man who will give away the northern channel. To the diplomatic community, his record in Ashford suggests a negotiator who understands that compromise is not the same as concession. And to Thessara, his appointment indicates that Delvaria has committed serious political capital to the process.

## Reactions

Sir Duncan Hale, Bobington's envoy in Thessara, issued a statement calling the designation "an important and welcome step toward substantive dialogue." Sources in Thessara said Hale had been briefed on the appointment before its public announcement — a further indication that the informal bilateral channel is functioning.

Thessarine Foreign Secretary Alaric Daine responded with characteristic care. "The Confederation notes the designation and reiterates its commitment to resolving differences through dialogue consistent with the Treaty of Ashen Bluffs." The reference to the treaty — which Delvaria's naval exercises have tested — is a reminder that Thessarine patience has limits. But the tone is notably measured.

In Bobington, Consul Pehr Lindqvist was seen arriving at the Delvarian consulate on Ashbury Lane shortly after the announcement. A brief statement from his office confirmed that "the consul has been in regular communication with the Ministry regarding procedural matters."

## The Market Responds

Copper, which had held at 885 florins per tonne on Tuesday, eased to 878 on the Bramblegate Exchange by the close of Wednesday trading — the sharpest single-day decline since the crisis began. Clement Varga at the Fernwich Trading House called the drop "cautious optimism rather than celebration."

"The market is pricing in the possibility of a resolution," Varga said. "It is not yet pricing in a resolution."

Shipping routes remain disrupted. Fourteen vessels continue to divert via the Cape of Sarenne, and no underwriter has resumed writing new Kaelmar-route policies. But the *Kharstad Gazette* — whose editorial posture has become a reliable barometer of Kharstad's intentions — ran the envoy announcement on its front page under a single-column headline, without commentary. Three consecutive days of restraint from the Gazette now constitutes a pattern.

## What Comes Next

The immediate question is venue. Sources suggest three options under discussion: Fenmouth, the neutral Ashford Republic port city where the 1962 Maritime Accords were signed; Bobington itself, where both consular networks are established; or a location in neither Delvarian nor Thessarine territory.

Hale is understood to favour Fenmouth for its symbolic weight. Delvaria has previously rejected the city as a site for multilateral talks, but a bilateral meeting is a different matter.

A first formal meeting between envoys could occur as early as this weekend, though diplomatic sources caution that procedural details — confidentiality protocols, agenda structure, the question of whether naval exercises continue during talks — remain under discussion.

"The machinery of peace is being assembled," Thornbury told this newspaper. "The question now is whether anyone tries to throw a spanner in it."

The *Kharstad Gazette* has not yet commented. In this climate, that may be the most encouraging signal of all.
