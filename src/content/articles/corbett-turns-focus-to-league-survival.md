There is a particular kind of madness that descends upon a football club that has just achieved something magnificent while simultaneously teetering on the edge of something catastrophic, and it was on full display at the Rovers' Thornhill training ground on Monday morning.

Outside the gates, a small crowd of supporters had gathered — perhaps forty or fifty, clutching programmes and scarves and the Monday edition of this newspaper — hoping for a glimpse of the cup heroes. Inside, Phillipa Corbett was running her squad through a set of tactical drills with the intensity of a woman who knows that glory is perishable and that the Premier Division table does not care how beautifully you struck a ball from thirty-five yards on Saturday night.

"The cup is in the cabinet," Corbett told reporters after the session, still in her training coat with the collar turned up against the February chill. "I'm very proud of it. The lads are very proud of it. Tomorrow we'll show it to the city and it will be a wonderful day. But on Wednesday morning, we are back here at half seven, and the only thing that matters is Haverford Town."

## Injury Concerns

The cup final exacted a physical toll that became clearer on Monday. Centre-back Orin Blackshaw, whose towering header brought the Rovers level in the seventy-second minute, was seen working separately from the main group with a heavily strapped right knee. Corbett described the injury as "a knock" but acknowledged that Blackshaw is "a doubt" for Saturday's match against Haverford.

More concerning is the condition of Nadia Osei, the dynamic winger whose surging run and cross created Kael Dunmore's winning goal in extra time. Osei did not train on Monday. Club medical staff confirmed she is being assessed for a hamstring strain sustained in the final's closing minutes.

"Nadia felt something tighten in the last ten minutes on Saturday and she played through it, which tells you everything about her character," Corbett said. "We'll know more in the next day or two. I'm hopeful but I won't take risks with anyone's fitness."

The potential absence of both Blackshaw and Osei for the Haverford match would be a significant blow. Blackshaw has been the bedrock of the Rovers' defence this season, and Osei's pace on the flank is one of the few weapons that consistently troubles opposing defences.

## The Table Does Not Lie

The Premier Division standings make for grim reading alongside the cup celebrations. The Rovers sit fifteenth, on twenty-six points from twenty-four matches — just three points above Millwall Athletic in the final relegation place. Fourteen matches remain, and the run-in includes away fixtures at league leaders Caravel City and third-placed Thornbury Academicals.

Haverford Town, who visit Bridgewater Stadium on Saturday, are themselves in thirteenth place on twenty-nine points — close enough to the relegation battle to make the match a genuine six-pointer for both sides.

"Every match from now until the end of the season is a cup final in its own right," said veteran defender Ronan Cahill, who has been with the Rovers through two previous relegation scrapes. "The lads know that. We've got the character — Saturday proved that. Now we have to show it every week."

## The Parade

Tuesday's cup parade, which will wind from Bridgewater Stadium through the Docklands and Midtown to Caldecott Square, is expected to draw as many as 150,000 supporters. The Rovers' squad will travel in open-topped carriages, with the Merchants' Cup displayed at the front of the procession.

Dunmore, whose thirty-five-yard strike in the 118th minute has already entered Rovers folklore, admitted he is looking forward to the parade with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.

"I've never been in a parade before," he said, grinning. "I'm not sure what you're supposed to do. Wave? Smile? Try not to fall off the carriage? Orin says he's going to push me off at Threadneedle Street, so I'll be keeping one eye on him."

Goalkeeper Sully Marsh, the squad's longest-serving player at nine years, was more reflective.

"I've been here through some dark days at this club," Marsh said. "Seasons where you couldn't give tickets away. To see 150,000 people in the streets for us — I can't put that into words. But Tommy Cahill is right. We owe those people more than a parade. We owe them a team that's still in the Premier Division next season."

## One Day at a Time

Corbett, who has managed the Rovers for three years and whose contract expires at the end of the season, was asked whether the cup victory had changed the club's plans regarding her future.

"You'd have to ask the board about that," she said, with the faintest suggestion of a smile. "I'm focused on Saturday. If I do my job well enough between now and May, the rest will take care of itself."

The Rovers host Haverford Town at Bridgewater Stadium on Saturday at three o'clock. Ticket sales have surged since the cup final, with the club reporting that the match is expected to be the first league fixture to sell out at Bridgewater this season.
