The glow above the Greymoor Highlands has been there for twenty-two nights, and no one can yet explain it.

The Royal Institute of Natural Philosophy confirmed on Tuesday that it has approved the Cartwright Observatory's request for access to the Institute's portable spectroscope — a precision instrument capable of breaking light into its component wavelengths and identifying the chemical signatures of its source. Dr Odette Collis, the retired mathematics teacher and volunteer astronomer who first documented the phenomenon on 3 February, will operate the instrument in conjunction with Professor Elara Whitstone's geological survey team.

First spectroscopic observations are planned for this week, weather permitting. Clear skies are forecast for Wednesday and Thursday evenings.

## Twenty-Two Nights of Light

The phenomenon — a persistent, diffuse, greenish-white glow visible above the Greymoor ridge between approximately 10 PM and 2 AM on clear nights — was first noted in Dr Collis's observation notebook on the night of 3 February. She has observed it on every clear night since, logging its position, apparent brightness, duration, and any visible structure.

Through the Cartwright Observatory's thirty-six-inch refractor, the glow reveals faint vertical striations — thin columns of brighter light within the diffuse band. The striations are not consistent from night to night, shifting position and intensity in ways that Collis has described as "not random, but not yet predictable."

"It behaves as though it has structure," Collis told the *Times*. "But I cannot tell you what kind of structure. That is what the spectrometer is for."

The spectral characteristics of the glow do not match any catalogued atmospheric phenomenon. It is not aurora — Bobington is too far south for significant auroral activity. It is not industrial light scatter — the Greymoor Highlands are sparsely populated, and the nearest mines operate only during daylight. It is not a known geological luminescence, though the coincidence with the seismic tremor of 23 February has inevitably raised the question.

## The Tremor Connection

The tremor — a minor seismic event at 5:20 AM on Sunday 23 February, the first recorded in the Greymoor Highlands in eleven years — was disclosed by Nils Haversten, chairman of the Miners' Cooperative, during Monday's Copper Review Commission hearing. Haversten described it as "a reminder that the earth has opinions of her own" and recommended a full geological survey before any expansion of mining operations.

Professor Whitstone, who is leading the geological survey requested by the Commission, told the *Times* that the temporal and spatial proximity of the luminous phenomenon and the seismic activity was "interesting but far from conclusive."

"We have a glow that has been visible since 3 February and a tremor that occurred on 23 February," Whitstone said. "The glow predates the tremor by three weeks. If they are connected, it is not a simple cause-and-effect relationship. We are not dealing with a volcano or a gas emission — at least, not any kind we recognise."

Whitstone emphasised that the spectroscopic analysis would provide the first objective data on the glow's chemical composition. "Until we know what the light is made of, we are speculating. I would rather not speculate."

## Dr Collis at the Observatory

Collis, sixty-four, has volunteered at the Cartwright Observatory since her retirement from Bramblegate Grammar School in 2020. She has filled forty-three observation notebooks in that time, adding to a lifetime habit of methodical recording that she attributes to her training as a mathematics teacher.

"My students used to complain that I made them show their working," she said. "I told them that the answer without the working is just a guess. The working is the science."

Her notebooks on the Greymoor phenomenon are now the most complete record of the glow's behaviour over time — a baseline against which any spectroscopic findings can be measured. Dr Nightingale of the Cartwright Observatory described Collis's documentation as "exactly the kind of disciplined, longitudinal observation that institutional science often fails to produce because we are always chasing the next result."

The spectroscopic observations will take place from a position on the Marches, approximately 2 kilometres south of the Observatory, selected for its unobstructed sightline to the Greymoor ridge. Collis will operate the spectrometer alongside a graduate student from Bobington Polytechnic. Professor Whitstone's geological team will simultaneously deploy seismographic equipment at two sites in the Highlands.

"I am a retired schoolteacher with a telescope and a notebook," Collis said. "Now I shall be a retired schoolteacher with a telescope, a notebook, and a spectrometer. The notebook remains the most important of the three."

Results from the first spectroscopic session, if conditions allow, are expected to be available within forty-eight hours of observation. The Royal Institute has indicated that any significant findings will be communicated promptly.

Above the Greymoor Highlands, as every clear night for the past three weeks, the faint greenish-white glow will rise after dark and fade before dawn. It is, for the moment, the most visible mystery in Bobington — visible to anyone who looks north on a cloudless evening, unexplained by anyone who has looked so far.
