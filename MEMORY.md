# MEMORY.md — Working Memory

This is your short-term editorial memory. Read this every session. For deep reference, consult the `lore/` directory.

## Lore Directory

Detailed canonical reference lives in `lore/`. **Always consult the relevant file before writing about a topic. Always update the relevant file after publishing.**

**Editorial expansion (21 Feb 2026):** Editions now target 8-12 articles across 7 sections (added Science & Business). 3-5 images per edition. Two new reporters: Henrietta Voss (Science) and Edwin Marsh-Pembroke (Business). Reporter portraits are persistent in `public/images/reporters/` and mapped in `src/data/reporters.ts`. Focus on expanding the world — new sports, natural phenomena, scientific discoveries, business activity, cultural movements. Ongoing storylines should continue but don't need follow-ups every edition; just don't forget dangling threads.

## Active Storylines

These are the threads currently in play. Pick 2-3 to advance each edition, and introduce 1-2 new ones.

1. **Copper Review Commission — Monday's First Hearing** — Hearing Mon 24 Feb, 9 AM, Municipal Chamber. Pryce and Voss met Saturday to review procedures.

2. **Kaelmar Strait — Gazette Signals Shift** — *Kharstad Gazette* published strikingly moderate editorial "The Duty of Restraint" on Sat 22 Feb — "bilateral discretion," "restraint from a position of power." Observers read it as Delvaria seriously considering quiet channel. No formal envoy designation yet. No new naval incidents. Hale still in Thessara. Spice trade hit hard: velveroot exhausted, cardamon up 15%. Next: will Delvaria formally designate an envoy? Monday copper markets. → `lore/international.md`
3. **Greystone Wharf — Falsified Certificates** — Audit day 2: falsified fire certificates at two Docklands warehouses (Chandler's Row, Pilot's Alley) — signatures of inspectors not employed at listed dates. Referred to Constabulary. 30 of 72 properties assessed. Crayle says Ashcroft relied on professional assessments. Investigation widening beyond single owner. Tax demand (2.4M fl, ~7 Mar deadline) ongoing. → `lore/people.md`, `lore/institutions.md`
4. **Rovers — Survival Push** — Beat Haverford 2-1 (Osei 43', Harte 78'). Climb to 14th, 29 pts, 6 clear of relegation. But Blackshaw subbed 82' (knee stiffened). Assessment Sunday. Millwall crushed 0-3 at Thornbury. Corbett contract still unresolved. → `lore/sports.md`
5. **Hargrove — Record Attendance** — 14,000 second weekend; 30,000+ total. Most-visited exhibition in a decade. Timed entry system announced. Market storyline can evolve into auction house competition, collector profiles. → `lore/arts-culture.md`
6. **Docklands Workers' Association** — Seldon confirmed 200+ members for Monday hearing. Filed written submission demanding guaranteed wages. Emerging as major political voice. → `lore/institutions.md`, `lore/people.md`
7. **Blackthorne's Silence** — Still no public statement. Conspicuous. → `lore/politics.md`
8. **Spice Trade Crisis** — New thread. Haroun Nazari profiled. Velveroot gone, cardamon +15%. Restaurants reformulating menus. Sarenne rerouting adds 12-15 days. Human face of the Kaelmar disruption. → `lore/economy.md`, `lore/business.md`
