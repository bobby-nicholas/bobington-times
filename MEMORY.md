This is your short-term editorial memory. Read this every session. For deep reference, consult the `lore/` directory.

## Lore Directory

Detailed canonical reference lives in `lore/`. **Always consult the relevant file before writing about a topic. Always update the relevant file after publishing.**

**Editorial expansion (21 Feb 2026):** Editions now target 8-12 articles across 7 sections (added Science & Business). 3-5 images per edition. Two new reporters: Henrietta Voss (Science) and Edwin Marsh-Pembroke (Business). Reporter portraits are persistent in `public/images/reporters/` and mapped in `src/data/reporters.ts`. Focus on expanding the world — new sports, natural phenomena, scientific discoveries, business activity, cultural movements. Ongoing storylines should continue but don't need follow-ups every edition; just don't forget dangling threads.

## Active Storylines

These are the threads currently in play. Pick 2-3 to advance each edition, and introduce 1-2 new ones.

1. **Copper Review Commission — Three Sessions Complete** — Session 2 (Tue 25 Feb): Seldon delivers transformative 37-min DWA testimony, names 3 workers (Halloran, Petra Voss, Obi), asks 14M florin transition fund. Merchants' Guild (Hadrian Voss) urges phased procurement. Insurance: Helmsley (Tidewater) and Felling (Exchange) testify to 420K in diversion claims. Five options now on table. Interim report expected Fri 28 Feb. Wed session: Kinnear and Whitstone. Commission report deadline 5 Mar. Next: will interim report narrow to shortlist? Whitstone's geology data? → `lore/economy.md`, `lore/politics.md`
2. **Kaelmar Strait — Envoy Designation Imminent** — Diplomatic sources (25 Feb) say Delvaria preparing to name senior diplomat as quiet channel envoy, possibly by Thu. Lindqvist's Mon visit was coordination on envoy mechanics. Hale: progress "tangible" (upgrade from "constructive"). *Kharstad Gazette* silent Tue — conspicuous discipline. Copper eased to 885. 14 vessels rerouting; fleet costs ~1.8M. Next: envoy named? First formal quiet channel meeting? → `lore/international.md`
3. **Greystone Wharf — Drury Summoned** — Constabulary summons Vincent Drury (Greystone Shipping) for Wed interview. Handwriting specialist found "consistent structural characteristics" across all 3 forged certificates — same hand. Crayle explicitly distances Ashcroft from Drury: "no ownership interest." 42 of 72 properties assessed; 4 falsified, 6 lapsed, 3 no records, 4 unauthorised habitation. Next: Drury interview, who is the forger? → `lore/people.md`, `lore/institutions.md`
4. **Rovers — Survival Without Blackshaw** — Blackshaw out 3+ weeks (medial inflammation, right knee). Misses next 4 matches: Duncastle (a), Caravel City (h), Thornbury (a), Ashwick Borough (h). Harwick (20, academy) to deputise. Possible return 21 Mar vs Port Caravel Wanderers. Corbett contract still unresolved. Rovers 14th, 29 pts, 6 clear. Next: Sat 1 Mar at Duncastle (16th, desperate). → `lore/sports.md`

6. **Docklands Workers' Association** — 200+ attended commission hearing in disciplined rows. Seldon to present oral testimony at Tue session. Emerging as major political voice. → `lore/institutions.md`, `lore/people.md`

8. **Spice Trade Crisis — Restaurants Adapting** — ESI hit 351 (25 Feb, new record, 24% in 11 days). Nazari limiting 14 of 32 varieties. 9 of 12 surveyed restaurants changed menus. Ashen Grill replaced entire eastern menu. Willow Table introduced "Greymoor preparation." Thirty-Mile Table fully booked (accidental beneficiary). Guild petition has 47 signatures. Emergency session Thu 27 Feb. Next: Guild session, further adaptation, does Foreign Office include spice in diplomacy? → `lore/economy.md`
9. **Fernwick Bridge — Ferry Approved** — Emergency ferry approved 25 Feb. Ashwater River Services (Gwen Alderly), 940K florins. Thornhill Reach to Bramblegate Steps, 15-min intervals, ~200 pax.

15. **Greymoor Seismic Tremor** — New thread. First tremor in 11 years (Sun 23 Feb, 5:20 AM). No damage, but mining cooperative recommends full geological survey before any expansion. Complicates commission calculus — domestic copper supply not a quick fix. → `lore/geography.md`
16. **Calloway Comet — CONFIRMED** — Southern Observatory (Ashford Republic) independently confirmed 25 Feb. First comet from Bobington in 41 years, first by non-credentialed observer.

First observations planned Wed/Thu 26-27 Feb (clear skies forecast). 22 consecutive clear nights observed. Glow predates tremor by 3 weeks — not simple cause-and-effect. Results expected within 48 hours. Next: spectroscopic results, what is the glow made of? → `lore/science.md`, `lore/people.md`
17. **The Thirty-Mile Table** — New thread. Arlo Kessling (26) opened a hyperlocal restaurant on Threadneedle Street sourcing all ingredients within 30 miles. 18 seats, 12 florins/meal.
