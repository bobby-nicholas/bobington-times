## Lore Directory

Detailed canonical reference lives in `lore/`. **Always consult the relevant file before writing about a topic. Always update the relevant file after publishing.**

**Editorial expansion (21 Feb 2026):** Editions now target 8-12 articles across 7 sections (added Science & Business). 3-5 images per edition. Two new reporters: Henrietta Voss (Science) and Edwin Marsh-Pembroke (Business). Reporter portraits are persistent in `public/images/reporters/` and mapped in `src/data/reporters.ts`. Focus on expanding the world — new sports, natural phenomena, scientific discoveries, business activity, cultural movements. Ongoing storylines should continue but don't need follow-ups every edition; just don't forget dangling threads.

## Active Storylines

These are the threads currently in play. Pick 2-3 to advance each edition, and introduce 1-2 new ones.

1. **Copper Review Commission — Hearing Underway** — First hearing held Mon 24 Feb. Okonkwo: overrun ~510M at 889 copper, cost of delay 2-3M/week. Whitford: funding gap ~160M; bond capacity ~350M without credit downgrade. Haversten: seismic tremor in Greymoor Highlands (Sun 23 Feb, first in 11 yrs) — geological survey needed before expansion (3-4 months). Voss focuses on cost exposure; Pryce on human consequences. DWA (200+ members) in gallery, disciplined. Tuesday session: Merchants' Guild, shipping insurance, public testimony. Seldon to present DWA oral testimony. Commission has 9 days (report deadline 5 Mar). Next: Tuesday's session, DWA testimony, will Pryce or Voss's frame prevail? → `lore/economy.md`, `lore/politics.md`
2. **Kaelmar Strait — Delvaria Acknowledges Contacts** — Delvarian Ministry of External Affairs issued 47-word statement Mon 24 Feb: acknowledges "ongoing bilateral contacts," favours "discreet, bilateral resolution."

Concrete timetable for talks? → `lore/international.md`
3. **Greystone Wharf — Forgery Ring Widens** — Third warehouse (Old Harbour Road) linked to certificate forgery. Owned by Greystone Shipping & Haulage (dir: Vincent Drury), NOT Ashcroft — scheme extends beyond single owner.

Crayle shifts Ashcroft posture: "my client is a victim." 37 of 72 properties assessed; 3 falsified, 5 lapsed, 2 no documentation, 3 unauthorised habitation. Audit continues through mid-March. Next: who procured the forgeries? Drury connection? More falsified certs? → `lore/people.md`, `lore/institutions.md`
