## Active Storylines

These are the threads currently in play. Pick 2-3 to advance each edition, and introduce 1-2 new ones.

1. **Copper Review Commission — First Meeting Monday** — Bipartisan commission (Pryce-Voss) meets Mon 24 Feb. Must report by 5 March. Three options: proceed (absorb 460M+ overrun at 879/tonne), redesign (aluminium, 18-month delay), or phase. Copper at 879 and climbing — Varga forecasts 900-910 by end of next week. Treasury reserves at 142M. Okonkwo, Treasury, copper suppliers to testify. What will they recommend? → `lore/economy.md`, `lore/politics.md`
2. **Kaelmar Strait — Lindqvist Meeting Friday** — Delvarian Consul Pehr Lindqvist requested private meeting with Bobington Foreign Office (expected Fri 21 Feb). First Delvarian diplomatic engagement since crisis began. Possibly connected to Hale's quiet channel. Hale still in Thessara; Daine assigned senior aide as interlocutor. The Stormbreak incident (Thessarine detained Delvarian trawler in southern channel) has raised tensions but also, perhaps, focused minds. Will Delvaria engage with the quiet channel? → `lore/international.md`
3. **Greystone Wharf — After the Interview** — Ashcroft spent 4 hours 15 mins at Constabulary HQ (Thu 20 Feb). Left via side exit without comment. Frye presented F&C documents on inflated insurance valuation (3.8M insured vs 1.9M city assessment). Two more former employees came forward (site manager, maintenance contractor). Insurance trail is central: F&C cooperating to show numbers came from client. Tax dimension: 2.4M vacant building levy outstanding. Docklands safety audit begins next week. Charges expected? → `lore/people.md`, `lore/institutions.md`
4. **Rovers: Blackshaw's Friday Test** — Passed light contact training Thursday. Full session Friday decisive — increasingly expected to start Saturday vs Haverford. Osei declared fully fit. Sellout 48,000. Corbett: "Nobody remembers the cup if you go down." Haverford (Llewellyn) won 2 of last 3 away. Millwall at Thornbury — relegation swing. Corbett contract still unresolved. → `lore/sports.md`
5. **Hargrove's Letter** — Hargrove broke her silence with a handwritten letter to Aldair decrying "the carnival of auction-house arithmetic." Published with permission. Grayle: "Sincerity is the most effective marketing." Market paradox: the letter will likely intensify, not calm, collector interest. Gallery extending hours, no price increase. Hargrove has no plans for further statements. Next angle: auction consignments, collector activity, or the cultural debate. → `lore/arts-culture.md`
6. **Docklands Workers' Association** — Foreman Patrick Seldon led 30 dockworkers to council gallery (19 Feb). Seeking formal meeting with council on workforce protections for 6,000 tramway workers. Labour tensions emerging as new political thread — connects to tramway, Greystone investigation, Docklands identity. No council response yet. → `lore/institutions.md`, `lore/people.md`
7. **Blackthorne's Balancing Act** — Mayor navigated Wednesday's session without taking a clear side. "Measured resolve." The Pryce-Voss commission is either a masterstroke of coalition management or a timebomb. If copper keeps rising, political pressure intensifies. → `lore/politics.md`
