# MEMORY.md — Working Memory

This is your short-term editorial memory. Read this every session. For deep reference, consult the `lore/` directory.

## Lore Directory

Detailed canonical reference lives in `lore/`. **Always consult the relevant file before writing about a topic. Always update the relevant file after publishing.**

**Editorial expansion (21 Feb 2026):** Editions now target 8-12 articles across 7 sections (added Science & Business). 3-5 images per edition. Two new reporters: Henrietta Voss (Science) and Edwin Marsh-Pembroke (Business). Reporter portraits are persistent in `public/images/reporters/` and mapped in `src/data/reporters.ts`. Focus on expanding the world — new sports, natural phenomena, scientific discoveries, business activity, cultural movements. Ongoing storylines should continue but don't need follow-ups every edition; just don't forget dangling threads.

See `lore/_index.md` for the full table of contents. Key files:

## Active Storylines

These are the threads currently in play. Pick 2-3 to advance each edition, and introduce 1-2 new ones.

1. **Copper Review Commission — Monday's First Hearing** — Bipartisan commission (Pryce-Voss) meets Mon 24 Feb, 9 AM, Municipal Chamber. Must report by 5 March. Three options: proceed (absorb ~490M overrun at 886/tonne), redesign (aluminium, 18-month delay), or phase. Copper at 886 and climbing (but rate slowing). Treasury reserves at 142M. Okonkwo, Whitford (Treasury), Haversten (Greymoor miners) to testify. Written submissions from Merchants' Guild, DWA, Historical Preservation Society. Seldon's DWA plans to attend in force. The Pryce-Voss dynamic is the political centrepiece. → `lore/economy.md`, `lore/politics.md`
2. **Kaelmar Strait — After Lindqvist** — Lindqvist met Undersecretary Marchetti at Foreign Office for 90 minutes (Fri 21 Feb). "Substantive and frank." Delvaria receptive but cautious on quiet channel: conditions include no preconditions on exercises, bilateral only, own envoy. Hale briefed in Thessara. Daine's office dropped "multilateral" from statement. Stormbreak still generating anger in Kharstad (*Gazette* front page on crew). Next: will Delvaria formally respond? Will they designate an envoy? Copper at 886. → `lore/international.md`
3. **Greystone Wharf — Audit and Tax Demand** — Docklands safety audit began Fri 21 Feb. Six teams, 72 properties, 14 assessed day one. Multiple lapsed fire safety certs found. Revenue Office issued formal demand to Ashcroft for 2,434,600 florins (14-day deadline, ~7 Mar). Crayle disputes. Two more former employees gave statements Friday. Investigation continues to widen. Charges? → `lore/people.md`, `lore/institutions.md`
4. **Rovers vs Haverford — Saturday 3 PM** — Blackshaw passed full training Friday, starts. Osei returns to wing. Unchanged XI otherwise. Sellout 48,000. Haverford (Llewellyn) compact and disciplined. Millwall at Thornbury — relegation implications. First league match since cup triumph. Corbett contract still unresolved. → `lore/sports.md`
5. **Hargrove — Market Continues** — Letter published, no further statements planned. Storyline can shift to auction house activity, collector behaviour, or cultural debate about commodification of art. Gallery extending hours. → `lore/arts-culture.md`
6. **Docklands Workers' Association** — Seldon welcomed the safety audit ("long overdue"). Still no council response to formal meeting request. Plans to attend Monday's commission hearing. Labour tensions remain an active thread. → `lore/institutions.md`, `lore/people.md`
7. **Blackthorne's Silence** — Mayor conspicuously absent from public commentary since commission established. Strategic or simply prudent? → `lore/politics.md`
