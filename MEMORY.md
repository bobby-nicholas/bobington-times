This is your short-term editorial memory. Read this every session. For deep reference, consult the `lore/` directory.

## Lore Directory

Detailed canonical reference lives in `lore/`. **Always consult the relevant file before writing about a topic. Always update the relevant file after publishing.**

**Editorial expansion (21 Feb 2026):** Editions now target 8-12 articles across 7 sections (added Science & Business). 3-5 images per edition. Two new reporters: Henrietta Voss (Science) and Edwin Marsh-Pembroke (Business). Reporter portraits are persistent in `public/images/reporters/` and mapped in `src/data/reporters.ts`. Focus on expanding the world — new sports, natural phenomena, scientific discoveries, business activity, cultural movements. Ongoing storylines should continue but don't need follow-ups every edition; just don't forget dangling threads.

## Active Storylines

These are the threads currently in play. Pick 2-3 to advance each edition, and introduce 1-2 new ones.

1. **Copper Review Commission — Hearing Underway** — First hearing held Mon 24 Feb. Okonkwo: overrun ~510M at 889 copper, cost of delay 2-3M/week. Whitford: funding gap ~160M; bond capacity ~350M without credit downgrade. Haversten: seismic tremor in Greymoor Highlands (Sun 23 Feb, first in 11 yrs) — geological survey needed before expansion (3-4 months). Voss focuses on cost exposure; Pryce on human consequences. DWA (200+ members) in gallery, disciplined. Tuesday session: Merchants' Guild, shipping insurance, public testimony. Seldon to present DWA oral testimony. Commission has 9 days (report deadline 5 Mar). Next: Tuesday's session, DWA testimony, will Pryce or Voss's frame prevail? → `lore/economy.md`, `lore/politics.md`
2. **Kaelmar Strait — Delvaria Acknowledges Contacts** — Delvarian Ministry of External Affairs issued 47-word statement Mon 24 Feb: acknowledges "ongoing bilateral contacts," favours "discreet, bilateral resolution." First official acknowledgement of any diplomatic process. Mirrors Hale's language. Hale: "constructive." Thessarine response measured (drops "reckless provocation"). Lindqvist at Foreign Office again Mon. No envoy named yet — key outstanding step. *Kharstad Gazette* ran statement on p2 without comment. Next: envoy designation? Concrete timetable for talks? → `lore/international.md`
3. **Greystone Wharf — Forgery Ring Widens** — Third warehouse (Old Harbour Road) linked to certificate forgery. Owned by Greystone Shipping & Haulage (dir: Vincent Drury), NOT Ashcroft — scheme extends beyond single owner. Retired Inspector Duxbury says his signature forged ("I have never set foot in that building"). Handwriting specialist retained. Crayle shifts Ashcroft posture: "my client is a victim." 37 of 72 properties assessed; 3 falsified, 5 lapsed, 2 no documentation, 3 unauthorised habitation. Audit continues through mid-March. Next: who procured the forgeries? Drury connection? More falsified certs? → `lore/people.md`, `lore/institutions.md`
4. **Rovers — Survival Without Blackshaw** — Blackshaw out 3+ weeks (medial inflammation, right knee). Misses next 4 matches: Duncastle (a), Caravel City (h), Thornbury (a), Ashwick Borough (h). Harwick (20, academy) to deputise. Possible return 21 Mar vs Port Caravel Wanderers. Corbett contract still unresolved. Rovers 14th, 29 pts, 6 clear. Next: Sat 1 Mar at Duncastle (16th, desperate). → `lore/sports.md`
5. **Hargrove — Record Attendance** — 30,000+ total. Most-visited exhibition in a decade. Timed entry announced. Market storyline can evolve. → `lore/arts-culture.md`
6. **Docklands Workers' Association** — 200+ attended commission hearing in disciplined rows. Seldon to present oral testimony at Tue session. Emerging as major political voice. → `lore/institutions.md`, `lore/people.md`
7. **Blackthorne's Silence** — Sent written message to commission ("full confidence") but still no public appearance or press conference. → `lore/politics.md`
8. **Spice Trade Crisis — Record Index** — Eastern Spice Index hit record 348 (up 22% in 10 days). 7+ restaurants pulled signature dishes. Merchants' Guild calls emergency session Thu 27 Feb at Guild Hall. Petition to Foreign Office to include spice trade in Kaelmar negotiations. Fontenoy (Verlaine's) has ~3 weeks of reserves. Next: Guild session outcome, further menu casualties, does Foreign Office include spice in diplomatic agenda? → `lore/economy.md`
9. **Fernwick Bridge — Year-Long Closure** — All four cables fractured (not three). Repair: 8-12 months, 55-65M florins. Emergency Ashwater ferry proposed (Thornhill Reach to Bramblegate Steps). Ferry cost: 800K-1.2M florins. Stroud: "Fernwick is the bridge that broke. It is not the only bridge that is old." Voss raised Fernwick during commission hearing. 400+ ageing structures in city portfolio. Next: ferry approval? Budget strain with tramway overrun? → `lore/geography.md`
10. **Caldwell-Bobington High-Speed Rail** — Parliament approved preliminary funding (340M of 9.8B total). Full budget vote early 2027. → `lore/geography.md`, `lore/institutions.md`
11. **Dunvale Mining Memorial** — Parliament approved 2.1M florins. Construction spring-autumn 2026. Links to Greymoor tremor (Haversten). → `lore/history.md`
12. **Bramblegate Fish Market Centenary** — Celebrations continue through week. → `lore/geography.md`
13. **Ringball Season** — Title race: Caravel 47, Lancers 45, Stoneflies 44, 6 rounds left. Stoneflies host Lancers next Sat. → `lore/sports.md`
14. **Windhallow Festival / Music Scene** — Festival concluded. Cultural legacy established. → `lore/arts-culture.md`
15. **Greymoor Seismic Tremor** — New thread. First tremor in 11 years (Sun 23 Feb, 5:20 AM). No damage, but mining cooperative recommends full geological survey before any expansion. Complicates commission calculus — domestic copper supply not a quick fix. → `lore/geography.md`
