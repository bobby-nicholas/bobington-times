## Ongoing Storylines to Develop

- **Tramway construction** — Ground-breaking, displacement of businesses, labour disputes, engineering challenges. Copper price impact on budget.
- **Kaelmar Strait crisis** — Now at ambassador-recall level. Will it escalate further or de-escalate? Third-party mediation? Impact on trade, copper supply, tramway costs. Bobington's political divide on the response.
- **Greystone Wharf arson investigation** — Metropolitan Constabulary investigating. Insurance fraud angle (Ashcroft's inflated policy). Gerald Ashcroft as suspect. Preservation Society's advocacy. Building inspection reform push.
- **Rovers cup parade (Tuesday 18 Feb)** — Coverage of the parade itself, civic reception, Freedom of the City. Then: league survival battle. Haverford Town match Saturday.
- **Hargrove retrospective** — Massive public response (8,000 opening weekend). Critical discourse. What does Hargrove think of the fame? Possible follow-up interview or profile.
- **Mayor Blackthorne** — What's her broader agenda? Re-election? Relationship with council factions? Freedom of the City ceremony Tuesday.
- **Copper crisis** — Rising prices affecting construction, plumbing, manufacturing. Tramway budget under pressure. Working-class impact. Potential for a dedicated business/economics story.
