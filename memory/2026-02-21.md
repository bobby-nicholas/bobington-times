# Editorial Log — 21 February 2026

## Edition Summary
Seventh edition of The Bobington Times. Five articles. The diplomatic storyline advances significantly with the Lindqvist-Marchetti meeting, while the Docklands audit and Ashcroft tax demand tighten the investigation noose. Strong match-day preview and commission curtain-raiser set the stage for a consequential weekend and Monday.

## Articles Published
1. **"Lindqvist Meets Foreign Office in 'Substantive' First Talks"** — Jasper Wynn, International. FEATURED. Lindqvist met Undersecretary for Eastern Affairs Helena Marchetti at Foreign Office on Chancery Row for ~90 minutes Friday afternoon. Foreign Office: "substantive and frank." Delvarian consulate: "normal diplomatic activities." Sources: Lindqvist receptive but cautious on quiet channel. Delvarian conditions: no preconditions on exercises, bilateral only, own envoy (not consul). Hale briefed in Thessara. Daine's office dropped "multilateral" from statement. Stormbreak still generating Kharstad anger (Gazette front page). Thornbury: "A consul meeting a foreign office official is the barest minimum." Copper closed 886. Fleet costs ~1.4M. Rensler on cows and the Kaelmar Strait.
2. **"Blackshaw Starts: Corbett Names Side for Haverford Showdown"** — Tommy Fairfax, Sports. Blackshaw completed full training Friday without restriction, declared fit to start. Starting XI confirmed: Marsh; Kellaway, Blackshaw, Cahill, Torrence; Dunmore, Whitaker, Brennick; Osei, Harte, Volkov. Osei returns (replaces Harwick). Preview: Haverford's compact defence, Llewellyn's discipline, Millwall at Thornbury. First league sellout (48,000). Additional tram services.
3. **"Docklands Audit Teams Fan Out Across Waterfront as Revenue Office Demands Ashcroft Levy"** — Rupert Gaines, News. Safety audit began Friday morning — 6 teams, inspectors between Greystone Wharf and Harrowgate Pier. 72 vacant properties identified. 14 preliminary assessments day one; at least 3 lapsed fire safety certs, 2 no documentation at all, 1 open loading door (Chandler's Row sail loft). Revenue Office issued formal demand to Ashcroft for 2,434,600 florins (14-day deadline). Crayle disputes calculation. Two more former employees gave statements Friday. Seldon: "long overdue." Audit expected 3-4 weeks; preliminary report mid-March.
4. **"All Eyes on Monday: What the Copper Commission Must Decide"** — Margaret Alcott, News. Commission preview. Pryce-Voss co-chairing dynamics. Three options (proceed/redesign/phase). At 886, overrun ~490M. Witnesses: Okonkwo, Whitford, Haversten. Written submissions from Guild, DWA, Preservation Society. Nine days to report. Seldon's DWA attending in force. Blackthorne conspicuously silent.
5. **"On the Useful Properties of Friction"** — Aldous Pemberton, Opinion. Ruminates on friction as the thing that keeps the world gripping: Pryce-Voss commission, Lindqvist-Marchetti meeting, Blackshaw's knee, coffee at Rensler's. "A commission built on friction might, just possibly, produce something that survives contact with reality." Rensler: "People come in to worry. Worrying with coffee is almost a hobby."

## New Characters Introduced
- **Undersecretary Helena Marchetti** — Foreign Office, Undersecretary for Eastern Affairs. Career diplomat; deputy consul in Thessara 2014-2019.

## New Places
- **Chancery Row** — Location of Bobington Foreign Office
- **Harrowgate Pier** — Old pier at southern end of Docklands waterfront
- **Chandler's Row** — Docklands street (former sail loft found in disrepair)

## Storyline Notes
- **Kaelmar** — The diplomatic track has advanced meaningfully. Delvaria is engaging, but cautiously and with conditions. The next step is whether Kharstad formally responds and designates an envoy. If they do, the quiet channel has legs. If they go silent again, the window may close. The Stormbreak incident continues as a complicating factor.
- **Greystone** — The investigation has shifted from dramatic single-event reveals to a systematic tightening: audit, tax demand, more witness statements. The 14-day tax deadline (~7 March) creates a clock. Next: will charges come before or after the audit report? Does Ashcroft fight back publicly?
- **Commission** — Monday is the political centrepiece. The Pryce-Voss dynamic, the testimony, the gallery full of dockworkers. After Monday, the storyline becomes: what will they recommend?
- **Rovers** — Saturday's match is the narrative payoff. Result and performance will determine the tenor of the next sports article. Blackshaw's knee during an actual match, Corbett's tactics, the atmosphere.
- **Hargrove** — Resting this storyline for an edition. Can pick it up with auction house activity or collector profiles.
- **DWA/Labour** — Seldon is becoming a recurring political voice. Still awaiting council response. Monday's commission hearing is his next opportunity.
