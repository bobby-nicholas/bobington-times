# Editorial Log — 20 February 2026

## Edition Summary
Sixth edition of The Bobington Times. Five articles. A pivotal day for the Greystone Wharf investigation — Ashcroft's formal interview — and significant diplomatic movement on the Kaelmar front. All major storylines advanced.

## Articles Published
1. **"Ashcroft Faces Four Hours of Questions as Investigation Widens"** — Rupert Gaines, News. FEATURED. Ashcroft arrived 9 AM, left 1:15 PM via side exit without comment. Crayle: "answered fully and cooperatively." Frye presented Fairweather & Chalk documents — internal correspondence on the 3.8M valuation (city assessed at 1.9M). Interview covered: insurance valuation/renewal, Breck's dismissal and patrol cessation, movements of senior employees before fire. Two more former employees came forward (former site manager, former maintenance contractor). Oakes: "He was simply the first to speak." F&C cooperation suggests they believe inflated numbers came from the client. Tax dimension: 2.4M vacant building levy outstanding. Docklands safety audit will review tax compliance.
2. **"Delvarian Consul Requests Meeting with Foreign Office in First Direct Engagement"** — Jasper Wynn, International. Consul Pehr Lindqvist requested private meeting with senior Foreign Office official (expected Fri). First Delvarian diplomatic engagement since crisis began. Stormbreak incident detailed: Thessarine corvette *Vantara* intercepted Delvarian trawler *Stormbreak* 4 NM south of treaty line, 6-hour detention, radio confiscated. Delvaria: "unacceptable provocation." Thessarine: "treaty obligations." Hale continues in Thessara; Daine assigned senior aide as interlocutor. Copper at 879 (Thu close). Varga revised forecast: 900-910 by end of next week. Merchants' Guild: 1.2M total cost to fleet. Tramway overrun now ~460M at current prices.
3. **"Corbett Demands Focus as Blackshaw Targets Haverford Return"** — Tommy Fairfax, Sports. Corbett: "Nobody remembers the cup if you go down." Blackshaw passed light contact training Thursday (cutting, turning, headers). Full session Friday decisive, increasingly expected to start. Osei declared fully fit. Haverford preview: Llewellyn's disciplined side, won 2 of 3 away, meanest travelling defence. Sellout 48,000. Additional tram services confirmed. Millwall at Thornbury — relegation implications. Corbett contract still unresolved.
4. **"Hargrove Breaks Silence: 'I Did Not Paint for Speculators'"** — Cecilia Montrose, Arts. Hargrove sent handwritten letter to Gallery Director Aldair, published with permission. Key quote: "I painted the Greymoor hills because the light demanded to be seen. I did not paint for auction catalogues." Full letter reproduced. Paradox: Grayle notes "sincerity is the most effective marketing." Aldair: no admission increase. Wed evening openings added from next week. Montrose revisits the retrospective for the third time — "Late Afternoon, High Moor" and "Morning, Ashford Bay." Renn reached: "Sounds like Isolde."
5. **"On the Art of Waiting"** — Aldous Pemberton, Opinion. A city in suspension: commission waits for Monday, Hale waits for Delvaria, Blackshaw waits for his knee, Ashcroft waits for what comes next, Hargrove waits for attention to subside. Pemberton on the three tramway options ("I approach most household repairs and all ambitious novels" like Option Three). On standing outside the Constabulary. On Hargrove's paradox ("an artist cannot criticise the commodification of her work without inadvertently accelerating it"). On knees as "anatomically absurd." Coffee at Rensler's — 4 florins, milk restored.

## Storyline Notes
- **Greystone investigation** is building steadily. The insurance trail is the strongest thread. F&C cooperating, two more witnesses, 4-hour interview. Next: charges? Or does Ashcroft fight back? The tax dimension (2.4M levy) adds another front.
- **Kaelmar** — Lindqvist's Friday meeting is the crucial next development. If Delvaria engages with the quiet channel, there's an off-ramp. If not, the Stormbreak incident shows how easily the situation could escalate. Copper approaching 900.
- **Rovers** — Blackshaw's Friday full training session is the final hurdle. Saturday's match is the first post-cup league test. Corbett's focus on survival vs. euphoria is a good tension.
- **Hargrove** — The letter was a perfect character moment. The market paradox plays out. No more Hargrove statements expected — the storyline can now shift to the auction houses and collectors.
- **Commission** — Monday's first meeting is the political centrepiece for next week's editions. Pryce and Voss together. The three options. Okonkwo testifying again.
- **Docklands Workers' Association** — Seldon's request for a formal meeting hasn't been addressed yet. Labour tensions remain a dormant thread to activate.
