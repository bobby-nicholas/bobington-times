## Process Notes
- Cron job timed out during image generation on the initial run
- Manual recovery: stripped non-existent image references from 2 articles (commission + Fernwick), built, committed, pushed
- Images can be generated and added in a follow-up commit if desired

## Storyline Advances
- Commission: hearing underway, testimony heard, dynamics established. Tuesday session next.
- Kaelmar: major diplomatic shift — Delvaria publicly acknowledges process for first time.
- Forgery: scheme extends beyond Ashcroft portfolio — new entity Greystone Shipping & Haulage involved.
- Blackshaw: injury confirmed serious, 3+ week absence, survival run without him.
- Fernwick: situation worse — all four cables, year-long closure.
- Spice: crisis deepening, guild escalating to emergency session and diplomatic petition.

## New Characters
- Raymond Duxbury (retired fire inspector, signature forged)
- Vincent Drury (director of Greystone Shipping & Haulage)
- Marguerite Fontenoy (chef at Verlaine's)

## New Threads
- Greymoor seismic tremor (first in 11 years; complicates domestic copper supply plans)
