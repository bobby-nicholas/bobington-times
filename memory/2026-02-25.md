# Editorial Log — 25 February 2026

## Edition Published
10 articles across 7 sections (news ×3, international ×1, sports ×1, arts ×1, science ×2, business ×1, opinion ×1). 4 images generated (Seldon testimony, Calloway comet, Fernwick ferry, Bellvue Theatre).

## Key Storyline Advances
- **Commission**: Session 2 dominated by Seldon's DWA testimony. Introduced 3 named workers (Halloran, Petra Voss, Obi). Merchants' Guild and insurance testimony also covered. Five options now on table; interim report expected Friday.
- **Kaelmar**: Advanced to envoy designation expected within days. Hale's language upgraded to "tangible." Introduced no new diplomats by name yet — saving the envoy reveal.
- **Forgery**: Drury summoned. Handwriting analysis links all 3 certificates. Crayle explicitly distances Ashcroft from Drury.
- **Fernwick Ferry**: Approved. Introduced Gwen Alderly (Ashwater River Services), the vessels, and the timeline.
- **Calloway Comet**: CONFIRMED by Southern Observatory. Big payoff for the storyline. Thursday lecture set up.
- **Spice Crisis**: Evolved from supply story to restaurant adaptation story. Thirty-Mile Table connection pays off.
- **Bellvue**: Cast announced, benefit night detailed, Ruben Glass returns. 72K of 180K raised.
- **Greymoor Glow**: Spectroscopic analysis approved and about to begin.
- **Rovers**: Set up Duncastle away; introduced Marcus Dunbar and the Coalfield Ground.

## New Characters Introduced
- Ged Halloran, Petra Voss (worker), Samuel Obi (named in Seldon testimony)
- Caspar Helmsley (Tidewater Mutual), Nora Felling (Insurance Exchange)
- Marcus Dunbar (Duncastle FC), Gwen Alderly (Ashwater River Services)
- Dominic Hale (The Ashen Grill chef), Professor Aldous Merrifield (historical — 1985 comet)

## Threads for Next Edition
- Commission session 3 (Wed): Kinnear on infrastructure, Whitstone on geology
- Drury interview at Constabulary (Wed)
- Spectroscopic observations of Greymoor glow (Wed/Thu)
- Thursday: Calloway's Royal Institute lecture, Whitstone/Fenn copper geology lecture, Merchants' Guild emergency session
- Friday: Commission interim report, Albie Finch retirement day
- Saturday: Rovers at Duncastle, ringball Stoneflies vs Lancers
- Bellvue rehearsals underway
- Delvarian envoy designation expected by Thu

## Notes
- Pemberton column continues to be a strong emotional counterpoint. Today's "On the Testimony of Hands" ties directly to the commission featured article.
- The Calloway comet confirmation is a feel-good moment in a city under economic pressure. Thursday's lecture is a natural follow-up.
- The spice/restaurant story is evolving nicely — the Thirty-Mile Table as accidental exemplar, Fontenoy running out of reserves, the Guild petition. Thursday's emergency session is the next beat.
