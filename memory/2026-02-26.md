# Editorial Log — 26 February 2026

## Edition Published
11 articles across 7 sections (news ×3, international ×1, sports ×2, arts ×1, science ×1, business ×1, opinion ×1). 4 images generated (commission Kinnear testimony, Delvarian ministry/envoy, Finch & Hollander on rounds, Greymoor spectrometer).

## Key Storyline Advances
- **Commission**: Session 3 with Kinnear (engineering) and Whitstone (geology). Kinnear's three design variants crystallise the choice. Whitstone's declining ore grades and unmapped fault at 4km depth make domestic copper expansion more complex. Commission clearly narrowing toward phased approach. Final session Thu.
- **Kaelmar**: The big break — Count Viktor Soren named as Delvarian envoy. Career moderate, father negotiated the Treaty. Copper dropped to 878. Machinery of peace assembling. First meeting expected within days.
- **Forgery**: Drury spent 3+ hours at Constabulary, blamed unnamed "compliance firm" for certificates. Companies Registry link to Ashcroft subsidiary uncovered. Web tightening.
- **Greymoor Glow**: Spectroscopy reveals geothermal venting (ionised nitrogen + sulphur dioxide). Not atmospheric — subsurface thermal source. Same system likely caused the tremor. Mining expansion complicated further.
- **Spice Crisis**: Two merchants shuttered (Rassam, Thorne). ESI at 356. Guild emergency session Thu. Envoy designation gives cautious hope.
- **Buried Waterway**: Dated to 1782 via mason's marks. "Lower Conduit" found in 1793 Harbourmaster's journal. 650m traced. Archaeological significance growing.
- **Bellvue**: First read-through went well. Ashworth commanding, Holloway promising. 74K of 180K raised.
- **Finch**: Penultimate round — teaching Hollander the human geography of Round 14. Lovely human-interest piece.
- **Sports**: Corbett drilling set-piece defence for Duncastle. Ringball title race preview (Stoneflies v Lancers Sat).
