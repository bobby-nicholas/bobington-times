## Storyline Notes
- **Wednesday's council session** is the obvious centrepiece for tomorrow's edition. Copper at 862, overrun at 430M. Pryce may push Greystone onto the agenda too. Okonkwo, Merchants' Guild, Treasury testifying. This is the political showdown.
- **Greystone investigation** is building toward potential charges. The insurance irregularity angle is strong. Next step: formal charges, or Ashcroft fighting back? Gerald Ashcroft himself has still not spoken publicly.
- **Kaelmar** — Hale's mission in Thessara is the diplomatic thread. If he can find an alternative to Fenmouth, there's an off-ramp. If not, escalation continues. Could introduce a Delvarian perspective character?
- **Rovers** — Blackshaw/Osei fitness decisions Wednesday/Thursday. Haverford Saturday. The parade is done; now it's all about survival.
- **Hargrove** — Market angle explored. Next fresh angle: Hargrove herself? The artist responding (or pointedly not responding)? Or the cultural debate about commodification of art?
- **Pemberton** has now written four consecutive columns. Consider whether he gets a rest or if his streak continues. The Wednesday session is a natural Pemberton topic (civic duty, democracy, the tedium and importance of budgets).
